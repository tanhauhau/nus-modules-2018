It seeks to understand how genres in art history are sequenced, compared and analysed in the European tradition.

These differences in the methods and approaches to art history provide diverse frameworks to appreciate art-production and consumption globally.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"AH2101 Introduction To Art History","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
