{"ModuleCode":"BZD6012","ModuleTitle":"Experimental Methods for Behavioral Research","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleDescription":"This course is aimed at doctoral students who intend to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research for the study of individualsâ€™ behavior in business (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior) and related disciplines (e.g., psychology). Topics include factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Importantly, the course examines these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician. That is, the course emphasizes the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analyses techniques for rigorous theory testing instead of focusing on statistical theory per se.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-4-3","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
