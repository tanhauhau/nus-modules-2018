{"ModuleCode":"SC4882A","ModuleTitle":"Perspectives on State & Society","Department":"Sociology","ModuleDescription":"What is the impact of globalization on the state, and how can we come to terms with these two concepts? What is the future form of state-society relations, and do concepts such as democracy, civil society, national identity and rethinking as we move into a highly connected world? Using cases from around the globe, students will be exposed to the very broad perspective offered by comparative and historical analysis. The course will initiate thinking about social welfare options and citizenship in a globalized world. Through historical and comparative analyses, critical questions about the role of the state in welfare provisions, economic development, and democratic development will be examined. This module is mounted for students throughout NUS with interest in the state-society relationship.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before\nCompleted 80MCs, including 28MCs in SC or 28MCs in PS with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
