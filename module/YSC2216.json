{"ModuleCode":"YSC2216","ModuleTitle":"Evolutionary Biology","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course aims to explore the study of biological evolution from a\nscientific standpoint. It covers topics such as population genetics,\nquantitative genetics and genomics, analysis of adaptation within and\namong species, phylogenetic analysis, and macroevolutionary patterns.\nSome major questions we will address include: Have organisms evolved for\n“the good of the species”? Why do some animals cooperate, and why do\nwe see some patterns in the behaviours of the sexes? We’ll examine these topics in lecture, readings of both primary and review literature, discussion,\nand laboratory exercises which focus on the basics of analytical techniques\nused in evolutionary studies.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-3-1-4.5","Prerequisite":"YC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and YC1131 Scientific Inquiry, although these requirements may change with curricular changes.
