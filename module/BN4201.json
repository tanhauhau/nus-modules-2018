{"ModuleCode":"BN4201","ModuleTitle":"Tissue Biomechanics","Department":"Biomedical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The module aims to provide an understanding of the relationship between structure and function in tissue biomechanics; introduce quantitative and qualitative assessment of hard and soft tissues in normal and pathological states; inculcate critical and constructive thinking regarding the recent research literature on tissue biomechanics and explore the potential clinical applications. The major topics include mechanical properties of bones, muscles, cartilage, ligaments/tendons, ocular tissues and cardiovascular tissues. Some examples of clinical applications include but are not limited to: tissue growth & remodelling, tendinitis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, aneurysms, glaucoma, myopia, corneal disorders.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0.5-0-2-4.5","Prerequisite":"BN2204 Fundamentals of Biomechanics","Preclusion":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-04T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
