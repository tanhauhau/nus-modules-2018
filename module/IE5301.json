{"ModuleCode":"IE5301","ModuleTitle":"Human Factors In Engineering And Design","Department":"Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt","ModuleDescription":"This module will focus on the interaction dynamics between the human operator and the machine/system in a human-machine system. We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g. the human-machine interface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall discuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-27T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
