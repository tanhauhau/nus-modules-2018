It then moves on to the open economy with trade and capital flows. Key issues covered here include the determination of exchange rate in the short- and long-run, how currency risk can be hedged, how economic “shocks” are transmitted internationally and what policy can achieve in response. Additional topics covered include: the interplay between financial markets, macroeconomics and policy, determinants of economic growth in the long-run with lessons from Asia, rising economic integration in Asia and implications on currency regime, global imbalance and policy adjustments, and perspectives on financial crises.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"40-0-0-10-10","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
