{"ModuleCode":"ISD5105","ModuleTitle":"Principles of Sustainable Urbanism","Department":"Dean's Office (School Of Design & Env)","ModuleDescription":"The accelerated, often rampant, growth of cities in Asia alters the quality of their inhabitantâ€™s lives, their ecological footprints and community bonds. Coping with urban growth affects not only those in the city; it affects also those in agricultural belts in rural peri-urban areas which are increasingly threatened by urban sprawl. This module investigates various historical and economic forces shaping urban developments, identifies the elements of urbanism that have a direct impact on the environment (such as transport infrastructure) and offers insights into how sustainability principles can lead to new paradigms for urban rejuvenation and growth.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
