{"ModuleCode":"GL4888A","ModuleTitle":"Justice and Emerging Technology","Department":"Political Science","ModuleDescription":"This module examines moral and public policy challenges presented by emergent technologies that challenge notions embodied in current institutions and theories of what is natural and what is subject to human manipulation, and even create entirely new domains of human activity and interest. These new technologies operate globally and often rapidly, generating consequences far beyond the location of their users. The module studies how social and political institutions—new or old—structure, regulate, develop, and distribute these technologies in accordance with various conceptions of justice.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognized non-language modules, or 28MCs in SC or 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track","Corequisite":"Nil","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-29T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
