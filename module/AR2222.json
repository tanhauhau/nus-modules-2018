{"ModuleCode":"AR2222","ModuleTitle":"History & Theory Of Western Architecture","Department":"Architecture","ModuleDescription":"This core introductory module looks at the production and development of architectural ideas in the Western European and Northern American historical context, from the Antiquities, the pre-modern to early modern, and the modern to postmodern/contemporary periods. The rich and complex historical trajectory underpins the constructedness of architectural knowledge. While by no means exhaustive, the specific thematic focus adopted for each lecture allows students to grasp the connections between epochal periods of architectural innovations and equally, their counter-movements.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-29T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
