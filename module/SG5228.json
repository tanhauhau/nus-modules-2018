{"ModuleCode":"SG5228","ModuleTitle":"Digital Innovation and Design","Department":"Institute Of Systems Science","ModuleDescription":"The next lap in IT Requirements Engineering will involve emerging Service Models. Such models involve value being co-created with and by both producers as well as consumers of the Service. The concept of value in use replaces the more traditional value in exchange. Helped by participatory technologies, co-created value may be derived not just from collaboration but also from collective intelligence. This module will cover the Service Innovation and Design spectrum from conception through design and implementation with key references to frameworks, models, patterns, methodologies, techniques and best practices. Topics are backed by practice workshops to hone the foundational knowledge and skills for the course.","ModuleCredit":"3","Workload":"6.5-0-0-10-3","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Saturday Morning"]}]}
