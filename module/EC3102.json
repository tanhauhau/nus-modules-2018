{"ModuleCode":"EC3102","ModuleTitle":"Macroeconomic Analysis II","Department":"Economics","ModuleDescription":"This course follows up on Macroeconomics I (EC2102). We review consumption and investment theories, and study the determinants of money demand and supply. Aggregate Supply functions under differing assumptions regarding labour-market clearing and price expectations (rational or adaptive) are derived next, and combined with the Aggregate Demand function to study policy and other effects. We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"EC2102, EC2101, AND (EC2104 OR ANY MA MODULE THAT IS NOT MA1301/MA1301FC/MA1301X OR MA1311 OR MA1312 OR MA1421)","Preclusion":"Nil","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-29T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-29T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
