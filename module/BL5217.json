{"ModuleCode":"BL5217","ModuleTitle":"Population Genomics and Phylogenomics","Department":"Biological Sciences","ModuleDescription":"The module will examine how genome-wide datasets can be applied to questions relating to the evolutionary history of animal and plant lineages. Some of the major topics discussed will be (1) genome-wide datasets used to entangle rapid radiations, (2) genome-wide SNPs deployed to discover patterns of gene flow between neighbouring lineages, (3) introgression and admixture across hybrid zones, and many more.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-8-10","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Morning"]}]}
