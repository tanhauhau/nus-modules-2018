{"ModuleCode":"CS3203","ModuleTitle":"Software Engineering Project","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This module provides students with hands-on experience in\nworking in project groups through a complete SDLC to\ndevelop a well-designed, well-tested, large-scaled software\nsystem. The students will apply the current best software\nengineering practices on the analysis, design,\nimplementation, and testing of software system. Through\nthe project, students will practise analysis of user’s needs,\nformulation of computing requirements to meet the user’s\nneeds, modelling and design of the computer systems\naccording to the requirements, evaluation of the design,\nefficient implementation of software components, system\nintegration, software version control, and rigorous testing.","ModuleCredit":"8","Workload":"2-2-0-10-6","Prerequisite":"(CS2103/T or CS2113/T) and (CS2101 or IS2101)","Preclusion":"CS3201, CS3202","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
