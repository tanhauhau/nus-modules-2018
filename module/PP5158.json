{"ModuleCode":"PP5158","ModuleTitle":"International Relations of Asia after WWII","Department":"Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy","ModuleDescription":"The course explores the connections among events in Asia as they have unfolded since the end of World War II and examines them in relation to contemporary issues. It assesses competing explanations for longstanding issues, including the Taiwan issue, division of the Korean peninsula, South China Sea dispute, and trajectory of regionalism. These issues are playing out amid a major power shift, not only as a consequence of China’s rise, but also with the emergence of Asia as a global agenda-setter. The course also examines the new threats to the region, from WMD proliferation to terrorism and competition for resources.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
