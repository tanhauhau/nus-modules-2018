{"ModuleCode":"LC5074","ModuleTitle":"Mergers & Acquisitions","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"The course will begin with an evaluation of the business rationale for M&As and a discussion of the various types of transactions and related terminology. The regulatory issues surrounding these transactions will be analysed through an examination of the applicable laws and regulations. While the law in Singapore would be considered as the frame of reference, the course will contain an international comparative perspective including comparisons with the position in the U.K. and the U.S. While corporate and securities law issues form the thrust, incidental reference will be made to accounting, tax and competition law considerations. Finally, the transactional perspective will consider various structuring matters, planning aspects, transaction costs and impact on various stakeholders.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS compulsory core curriculum or equivalent","History":[{"Semester":2}]}
