{"ModuleCode":"YHU3263","ModuleTitle":"The Bandung Conference of 1955","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the Bandung Conference of 1955 stands as a symbolic event in the history of decolonisation of Asia and Africa. We examine ‘Bandung’ as a nodal point from which a variety of postwar narratives emerged, including freedom and independence, non-alignment, Third World internationalism, connecting even the US civil rights movement with Bandung. A diverse range of materials will be explored, including popular writing, film, photographs, newsreels, newspapers, journals, official documents, as well as a field trip to the conference museum in Bandung to consider the role of public history.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-1-9.5","Prerequisite":"All Common Curriculum modules in the first two years.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
