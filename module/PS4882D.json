{"ModuleCode":"PS4882D","ModuleTitle":"Topics in IR: Politics of Global Migration","Department":"Political Science","ModuleDescription":"This seminar examines the causes and consequences of transnational migration, a complex and little understood aspect of globalisation. How have governments and international organizations responded to mass population movements? How has transnational migration been treated as a political, economic, security, and human rights issue? What are the gender aspects of migration? We will explore these topics through historical and contemporary perspectives on migrants and refugees. We will consider a wide range of sending and receiving countries, focusing on states and movements in Southeast Asia.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
