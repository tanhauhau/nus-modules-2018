{"ModuleCode":"TS3246","ModuleTitle":"Shakespeare and Asian Performances","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"Shakespeare’s plays have been known in many parts of Asia for about 100 years, and contemporary Asian theatre practice shows at once a great diversity of approaches to them, and patterns of common interest in production and reception. This module takes recent productions from different theatre cultures to compare how Shakespeare’s texts are engaged through non-realist aesthetic principles, and how self-reflexive treatments of naturalism, as well as new scripts based on his plays, interact with the cultural values represented by Shakespeare in the East and Southeast Asian region. Assessment includes the option of a creative project.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003 or EN1101E or GEK1000","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
