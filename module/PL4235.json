{"ModuleCode":"PL4235","ModuleTitle":"The Psychology of Moral Judgments","Department":"Psychology","ModuleDescription":"This module will introduce students to the study of the origins, development, and cognitive processing of morality. The module will cover the history of moral psychology, and the shift from cognitive-developmentalist theories of reasoning-based morality to the current social intuitionist theory of intuition and emotion based morality. The course debates whether morality is innate, intuitive, emotion-driven, reasoned, learned, or a dual process. In doing so, we will explore infants’ and children’s moral development, moral emotions, morality through neuroscience, morality across culture and in politics, and moral dilemmas from philosophical thought experiments.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3.5-6","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232 - PL3236), which should include PL3234 and PL3235, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
