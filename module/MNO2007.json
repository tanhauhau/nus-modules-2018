{"ModuleCode":"MNO2007","ModuleTitle":"Leadership and Ethics","Department":"Management And Organisation","ModuleDescription":"In this module we explore the age-old question of the relationship between ethics and leadership. We begin by examining the theoretical underpinnings of leadership and ethics. We then move to consider how ethics and leadership are intertwined, especially in work organizations. Organizations are “strong situations” which exert considerable influence on leaders’ perceptions, interpretations, judgements, decisions and behaviours. We consider how leaders can enhance ethical awareness, make decisions with ethics in mind, organize for ethical behaviour and face ethical challenges at the organizational level.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"MNO1001 Management and Organization","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
