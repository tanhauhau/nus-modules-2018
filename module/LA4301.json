{"ModuleCode":"LA4301","ModuleTitle":"Material and Design","Department":"Architecture","ModuleDescription":"This module provides an understanding of materials as they pertain to landscape design. Outdoor designs require robust materials that tolerate extreme weather conditions, planned and unplanned forms of use and urban characteristics like highest intensities of usage and vandalism. The discourse on materials is integrated with their design process and application on site. Contemporary urban landscape design bases upon a minimized choice of appropriate materials and high quality of implementation.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-0-6-0","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"]}]}
