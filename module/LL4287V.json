It deals primarily with Law but is also attentive to the Non Law and Quasi Law aspects inherent in ASEAN’s character as an international actor and regional organisation; its purposes and principles; and its operational modalities, processes, and institutions. Students will grasp the complexities of ASEAN’s conversion to the rule of law and rule of institutions within the context of international law and its frameworks; national competences and jurisdiction; and regional relations and realpolitik.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
