{"ModuleCode":"LL4313V","ModuleTitle":"Mediation/Conciliation of Inter- & Investor-State Disputes","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"Recent years have witnessed more state-to-state and investor-state disputes, with a substantial increase in resources spent on binding arbitration. Mediation and conciliation are rarely attempted and more rarely successful. This course introduces the student to methods of mediation and conciliation on the international law plane, and surveys existing institutional regimes (ie, ICSID, PCA, SIAC). The focus will then turn to identification and critical analysis of the special legal and policy obstacles to voluntary dispute settlement by states (including SOEs), as well as countervailing incentives. The scope is international, with some readings devoted to Asia. Students will study and critique precedents, and conduct basic mediation/conciliation exercises.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
