{"ModuleCode":"UQF2101G","ModuleTitle":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. This module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","Preclusion":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","Corequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
