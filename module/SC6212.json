{"ModuleCode":"SC6212","ModuleTitle":"Global Transformations","Department":"Sociology","ModuleDescription":"This seminar will examine the complexities and the challenges to global social order and peace. With global transformation and the emergence of an interdependent world society, there has been a proliferation of risks. From ecological crises to the intensification of poverty, social inequality and social exclusion to the conflicts and violence on ethnic and religious lines have made the world a risky place. Theories of globalization will be applied to examine the social contexts and consequences of these crises, risks and violence. Globalization will be viewed as a complex process of cultural clashes intersecting with modern economy and polity. Using an inter-disciplinary framework, the seminar will explore the possibilities of minimizing risks and violence in a new global social order.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"SC6211A","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
