{"ModuleCode":"YCC2137","ModuleTitle":"Scientific Inquiry 2","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Building upon SI1 and QR, SI2 develops deeper understanding and application of scientific modes of inquiry by tackling a topical question in science, e.g. climate change, origins of our universe, artificial intelligence, etc. The semester focuses on a single central question. Students explore related issues in breadth and depth: Breadth from a general introduction to the central question; depth from six weeks on one aspect of their choice. The course ends with a synthesis segment, where students work in teams to put together various elements learned, much as scientific teams today assimilate multi-faceted evidence and solutions to address current problems.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"1-3-0-4-4.5","Prerequisite":"YCC1131 Scientific Inquiry 1 and YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
