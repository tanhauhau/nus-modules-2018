{"ModuleCode":"UTW1001Y","ModuleTitle":"Algorithmic Culture and its Discontents","Department":"Ctr For English Language Communication","ModuleDescription":"We live in the age of Big Data, but where is our relationship with technology leading us? In this writing module, we interrogate the entity that we call the algorithm through the lens of the cultural meanings ascribed to it. We ask how those meanings shape our material reality. Various phenomena will be critically discussed, such as the lure of Netflix, the ubiquity of fitness trackers, and the use of smart technology by states to govern. Ultimately, through deep reading and analytical writing, we will engage with the question of what it means to be human in a technological society.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules","Preclusion":"Students who have already read a IEM1201%, UTW1001% and ES1501% module.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
