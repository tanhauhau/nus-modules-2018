{"ModuleCode":"USE2209","ModuleTitle":"Globalizing Asian-Pacific Identities","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"Some social actors make purposeful use of hybrid forms. In this module we study identity fashionings as layered as those of a subsection of Japanese youth culture in which ganguro girls’ skin, hair and clothes draw comparison to stereotypical depictions of African Americans. We probe what some analysts perceive, and what we perceive, in these Asian-Pacific subjects’ decision to ‘sample’ facets of a modern Other’s identity. This module, a revamp of one titled ‘Historicising the Black Pacific’, welcomes students of negotiations of raced subjectivities, broadly construed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-3-3","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
