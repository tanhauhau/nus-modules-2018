{"ModuleCode":"SE2213","ModuleTitle":"Politics in Southeast Asia","Department":"Southeast Asian Studies","ModuleDescription":"Political systems in Southeast display a great variety of characteristics. Some, for example, are authoritarian while others are democratic. Some appear stable while others are subject to tumultuous change. This module examines the historical background and the nature of political competition in different countries of the region: how various groups have succeeded or failed in gaining power, the institutions that structure political contests, and the ideas behind different political agendas. The aim is to provide a multidisciplinary understanding of politics in Southeast Asia with which we can revisit ongoing debates on such issues as democracy, legitimacy, stability and reform.","CrossModule":"SSA2207","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-4-3","Preclusion":"SE2281 or SSA2207 or SS2207SE, SC2207","Corequisite":"NIL","Types":["UEM","SSM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-04T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
