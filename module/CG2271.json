{"ModuleCode":"CG2271","ModuleTitle":"Real-Time Operating Systems","Department":"Computing & Engineering","ModuleDescription":"Real-time systems must respond quickly to inputs from the environment in order to work effectively and safely, and realtime operating systems (RTOS) are a critical part of such systems. In this course the student is exposed to basic RTOS concepts like tasks, scheduling algorithms, RTOS customisation and concurrent real-time programming. By the end of this course a student will not only understand how an RTOS is built, but will also gain practical hands-on experience in customising RTOSs and in writing real-time programs.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-2-3-2","Prerequisite":"CS1020/E Data Structures and Algorithms I\nCS2040/C Data Structures and Algorithms","Preclusion":"CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems","Corequisite":"","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-05T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-09T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
