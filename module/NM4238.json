{"ModuleCode":"NM4238","ModuleTitle":"Software Studies","Department":"Communications And New Media","ModuleDescription":"Software has worked its way in to almost every aspect of our lives. Code is not just neutral technology, but is subject to cultural, economic, and political interests. Similarly our cultural lives are profoundly influenced by software â€“ by its development and dissemination (collaboration and open-source), how we work (the paperless office, outsourcing), communicate (friends networks), conduct transactions (bitcoins), enact subversion, its reflection of race and gender divisions, its expressive capabilities (new media art), and reconceptualization of knowledge in programmatic form. This course approaches software from the perspective of humanities and social sciences to critically examine the relationship and interdependencies between culture and software.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-4-5.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
