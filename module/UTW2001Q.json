{"ModuleCode":"UTW2001Q","ModuleTitle":"'What's in a word?' Meaning across cultures","Department":"Ctr For English Language Communication","ModuleDescription":"It is often assumed that there is a common understanding of what specific words mean. However, can one assume a common understanding across cultures of words describing colour, such as 'red' or 'maroon,' or emotion, such as 'happiness,' 'pleasure,' or 'disgust'? Are forms of address, such as nicknames, or interjections, such as 'damn' or the 'F' word, used in similar ways across cultures? Are there differences between the ways that speakers of different varieties of English understand the meanings of such words? This module explores how meaning is culture-bound, and helps students understand cultural differences in the choice and use of words.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"I&E I","Preclusion":"(i)\tUSP students may read any I&E module, but not in lieu of a Writing and Critical Thinking module.\n(ii)\tStudents who have already read an I&E II module.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
