{"ModuleCode":"YHU4206","ModuleTitle":"The History of History","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Practitioners of every discipline benefit from having an understanding of their discipline’s history. This is especially true for historians, whose work demands an acquaintance with the history of the writing practices and the modes of conceptualizing the past to which they are heirs. Through an engagement with foundational texts from the eighteenth century to the present, this course explores the emergence and development of modern historiography. Students will learn about the diverse ways in which the past has been represented, narrated, and interpreted; they will also examine how historians’ interpretations of the past are themselves imbedded in specific historical contexts.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-9.5","Prerequisite":"None but open to Juniors and Seniors only. Priority will be given to students in the History major/minor.","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"]}]}
