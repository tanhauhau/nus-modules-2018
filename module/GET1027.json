Plato worried about this; so will we.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-2-4","Preclusion":"GEM1004","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-08T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon"]}]}
