{"ModuleCode":"UTC1702E","ModuleTitle":"Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems","Department":"Residential College 4","ModuleDescription":"Are energy sources infinite? Do energy policies lead to a sustainable energy development? Would renewables solve our future energy needs, mitigate emissions and protect our environment? Students deal with such energy challenges by learning to understand ‘energy systems’ as a ‘complex whole’. This module provides a platform for students to understand the complex behavior arising from interdependent interactions of different actors of energy systems with other economic, political, social, technological and environmental factors. To achieve this, it engages students to learn and apply systems thinking tools to such aforementioned challenges through relevant models, case studies and real-world energy policy/problem scenarios.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"GEM-coded: GEM1915:Towards an Understanding of the Complex World GEM1914 Jr Sem: Systems: Systems Everywhere GEM1915 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World GEM1918 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources GEM1919 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare GE Reform: GET1011 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World UTC-coded: UTC1411: Jr Sem: Systems: Systems Everywhere UTC1702A: Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources UTC1702B:Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare UTC1702C: Thinking in Systems: Sustainability and Us UTC1702D: Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics To be precluded with: all other topics offered under the UTC1702 parent module","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Evening"]}]}
