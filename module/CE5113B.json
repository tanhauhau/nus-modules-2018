{"ModuleCode":"CE5113B","ModuleTitle":"Geophysical Methods & Geotechnical Monitoring","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module teaches the essential concepts and methodology for the planning, design and implementation of geophysical methods for geotechnical site investigation, and ground instrumentation and monitoring programmes. The module will be broadly divided into two parts. The first part covers the planning and practices of various type of geophysical methods used in geotechnical site investigation. Basic type of geophysical methods: seismic, resistivity and ground radar and others will be covered. The second part covers various aspects of ground instrumentation and sensors for the measurement and monitoring of ground movement, drawdown, excess pore pressures, strut forces, wall deflection and settlement. Concept and practices of the observational methods in geotechnical works will be covered. This module enables participants to acquire the knowledge and practical skills through the lectures, case studies and projects.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"1-0-0-0.5-3.5","Prerequisite":"Background in soil mechanics or equivalent and CE5113A Basic Geotechnical Investigation according to EC7","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening","Saturday Morning"]}]}
