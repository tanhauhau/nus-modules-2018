Major topics covered include Discounted Cash Flow Valuation, Relative Valuation, Multifactor Models, Liquidity, and Value Enhancement Strategies. Lectures will involve frequent interaction with practitioners from the industry, hands-on lab projects, and real-life examples. Students are also expected to research, write, and publish equity investment reports (preferably on companies with limited research analyst coverage) and/or portfolio investment strategies. These individual equity reports and a presentation in the form of a team-based stock pitch will subsequently be presented by the students to a panel of senior members from the Singapore investment management industry so as to showcase & ascertain studentsâ€™ equity research and stock-picking skills. There may also be an opportunity to put our skills to the test and manage real money (i.e., a live student-managed fund) during the course of the semester. This course is suitable for students interested in a career as a financial analyst (both on the buy-side and sell-side), or as a portfolio manager.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"- ACC1002 Financial Accounting - FIN3101 Corporate Finance - FIN3102 Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
