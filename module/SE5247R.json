{"ModuleCode":"SE5247R","ModuleTitle":"Country Studies: Vietnam","Department":"Southeast Asian Studies","ModuleDescription":"Vietnam is a country of apparent contradictions, where a ruling Communist party espouses freemarket economics, a young and optimistic population traces its origins back more than 4000 years, and a sustained engagement with China coexists with a fierce commitment to national independence. This module makes sense of some of these contradictions by exploring key issues in Vietnamâ€™s past and present such as imperialism, nationalism, regionalism, Confucianism, colonial rule, war, Communism, economic reform, and the environment.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
