{"ModuleCode":"PP5184","ModuleTitle":"Communications for Public Leadership","Department":"Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy","ModuleDescription":"Public policy is not just made. It must also be explained. To\nbe effective in positions of authority, public leaders should\nbe able not just to analyse policy, but to talk and write\nabout it as well — to communicate succinctly and\npersuasively, to frame issues, and to grapple with the\nworlds of ideas and perceptions, all taking place within a\nfast-moving digital media environment.\nThis course is designed to help future leaders improve their\nability to speak and write in challenging situations, from\nwinning over hostile audiences to giving TED-style talks\nand writing punchy op-eds suitable for publication in global\nmedia outlets. Having taken it, students will emerge with a\ndeeper understanding of differing styles of communication\nin public life — and the ability to begin to develop their own.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-0-7","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
