{"ModuleCode":"CS5222","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Computer Architecture","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"The aim of this module is to introduce the state-of-the-art architectural advances underlying the current generation of computing systems. A review of pipelined processor design and hierarchical memory design is followed by advanced topics including exploitation of instruction-level parallelism through dynamic instruction scheduling and speculation, exploiting thread-level parallelism through multiprocessors, and optimizations for memory and storage subsystems. Throughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on cost-performance-power-reliability trade-offs in designing the different architectural components.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0-0-4-4","Prerequisite":"CS3220 Computer Architecture or CS4223 Multi-core Architecture","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
