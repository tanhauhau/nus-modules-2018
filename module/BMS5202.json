{"ModuleCode":"BMS5202","ModuleTitle":"Global Supply Chain Management","Department":"Dean's Office (Biz)","ModuleDescription":"The internationalization of companies have created global supply chains, with opportunities for growth, and risks of disruption. In the context of Asia, these challenges and opportunities are twofold: operating in Asia, as well as for Asian companies aspiring to grow regionally and globally. Companies will have to continuously evaluate their strategies and adapt their supply chains to deal with these changes and adapt their business models. Starting from the companyâ€™s corporate strategy, we will look at how global chains can be configured to support the strategic goals of companies, and operationalizing their goals successfully and cost-effectively. We will also look at how emerging and evolving macrotrends in trade, regulations and technologies, are causing changes to companies and whole industries in their traditional supply chains structures and assumptions, and how to adapt to these changes.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-4-3","Preclusion":"DSC5211A Supply Chain Coordintaion and Risk Management","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning"]}]}
