{"ModuleCode":"IE3110E","ModuleTitle":"Simulation","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given problems.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-1-0.5-4-4","Preclusion":"DSC3221, TIE3110","Corequisite":"IE2100E or DSC3215","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]}]}
