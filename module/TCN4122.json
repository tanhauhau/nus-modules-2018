{"ModuleCode":"TCN4122","ModuleTitle":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes.","ModuleCredit":"3","Workload":"2-2-0-1.5-2","Prerequisite":"TCN2116, TCN2121, TCN3124 & TCN3132","Preclusion":"CN4122E","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-24T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
