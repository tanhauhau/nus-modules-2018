{"ModuleCode":"CM3242","ModuleTitle":"Instrumental Analysis II","Department":"Chemistry","ModuleDescription":"The module covers the advanced treatment of some concepts that are applied to the analytical chemistry field already taught at the introductory level in other modules (CM1131, CM2111, CM2101, CM 2121, CM2161, CM2192 (practical module)), plus more advanced techniques important in the fast moving world of contemporary analytical chemistry. More advanced considerations of the instrumentation aspects of important analytical techniques are taught and discussed, and wide-ranging applications of these techniques to solving problems in various fields are covered. The topics covered include advanced microscale separation science, mass spectrometry, spectrophotometry, electroanalysis, thermal and gravimetric methods, and flow injection analysis.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"4-1-0-2-3","Prerequisite":"CM2142 or CM2192 or LSM2191","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-29T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Monday Afternoon"]}]}
