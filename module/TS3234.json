Through a variety of texts including films, video games, public speeches, and social media posts, the module teaches how the production and circulation of popular forms can be read as performance: how they are produced or packaged for consumption, how the consumer relates to them and how their success or failure is measured. It will show the pervasiveness and relevance of performativity in everyday physical and online interactions.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003","Preclusion":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
