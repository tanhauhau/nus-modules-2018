{"ModuleCode":"YSS3256","ModuleTitle":"Youth Urbanism: Global Trends, Local Perspectives","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course explores the relationship between youths and their urban environments from a global perspective. More than half of the worldâ€™s young people live in cities today, where they contribute to urban life from everyday use of street space to participation in politics and transnational mobility. Yet, structures of inequality continue to frame their lives. Through the lens of youth urbanism, students examine theories, debates, and policy concerns across social inequalities, education/employment, migration, citizenship, and politics - themes relevant to the fields of Urban Studies and Global Affairs. Critical evaluation, writing, and project-work skills will also be developed through assignments.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-6.5-3","Prerequisite":"Prior enrolment in YSS2220 Introduction to Urban Studies OR YSS2224 Introduction to Global Affairs OR permission of the instructor","Corequisite":"Current enrolment in YSS2220 Introduction to Urban Studies OR YSS2224 Introduction to Global Affairs OR permission of the instructor","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning"]}]}
