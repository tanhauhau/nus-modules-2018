{"ModuleCode":"PL4241","ModuleTitle":"Exploring Consciousness â€“ Theory and Neuroscience","Department":"Psychology","ModuleDescription":"Perceptual consciousness allows us to interact with the world that we live in through touch, sight, sound, smell and taste. In addition, conscious decision-making (free will) allows us to interact with our surroundings in ways that fulfil our goals and desires. In this course, we will discuss neuroscientific, psychological and philosophical investigations on conscious perception and decision-making. We will discuss the methods used to study it, and importantly, highlight the limitations of our current understanding in the field.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232 - PL3236), which should include PL3232 and PL3233, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
