{"ModuleCode":"LSM4216","ModuleTitle":"Molecular Nutrition and Metabolic Biology","Department":"Biochemistry","ModuleDescription":"Nutrients are essential for sustenance. Nutrients and metabolites have a deep impact on cellular response and adaptation at the genetic, epigenetic and signalling level and vice versa. Nutrients also have an effect on intestinal microbiota, which in turn alters the absorption and utilization of nutrients. This module will cover interactions between nutrients and genes, epigenetics, cell signalling and microbiota. Molecular approaches to conduct nutrition related research would be discussed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"LSM2101 and LSM2102","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-05T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
