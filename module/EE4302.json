{"ModuleCode":"EE4302","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Control Systems","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module provides the foundation for a more advanced level control systems course. Topics include system description, controllability, observability, selection of pole locations for good design, observer design, full-order and reduced-order observers, combined control law and observer. It is also a first course in nonlinear systems and control. Topics include non-linearities in control systems, use of root-locus in analysis of non-linear systems, describing function and its use in analysis and design of control systems, non-linear ordinary differential equations, singular points, and phase-plane analysis.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.0-1.0-0.5-2.5-4.0","Prerequisite":"EE3331C","History":[{"Semester":3},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon"]}]}
