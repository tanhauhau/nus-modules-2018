{"ModuleCode":"GEH1065","ModuleTitle":"Art in Society","Department":"Malay Studies","ModuleDescription":"In this module students will learn that art does not exist apart from society. What is considered art is determined by ideas within a particular time period and social institutions. Furthermore, art is not only about the artist. As a social activity, art making involves elaborate cooperation among specialised personnel. Giving focus to visual art and using examples from Southeast Asia and beyond, topics covered include gender in the arts; governments, economies and religion in shaping the arts; artists and their art making as well as social dimensions of aesthetic experience and interpretation of art works.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Types":["GEM2015"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-27T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
