{"ModuleCode":"YID3214","ModuleTitle":"Urban Ecological Systems","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"With an increasingly urbanised human population the interaction of nature with the built environment and its human inhabitants is emerging as one of the greatest sources of both opportunity and inertia to goals of sustainability. In this course you will consider the extent to which urbanisation has changed natural ecosystems and led to the rise of a new urban ecology, and consider how humans can value and manage this in a socio-ecological context. We will then address how the confluence of climate change, globalisation and urbanisation are fundamentally altering our living space and the implications for human health and wellness.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"One module in environmental studies OR one module in urban studies OR permission of the instructor","Preclusion":"YSS3272 Urban Ecological Systems (previous code)","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
