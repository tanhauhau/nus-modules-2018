{"ModuleCode":"CH2244","ModuleTitle":"Chinese Women: Traditions and Transformations","Department":"Chinese Studies","ModuleDescription":"According to conventional assumptions, traditional Chinese women were particularly oppressed and it is only in the modern age that gender equality is finally realized. Such a simplistic view of diving Chinese history into two mutually exclusive ages of \"traditional\" and \"modern\" cannot do justice to the complexity of women's experiences. This course sets out to provide a more complex picture of women's lives in both pre-modern and modern eras. Lecture materials will mainly be in English while lectures will be delivered in simple Mandarin, but students can choose to do all readings and class assignments in either English or Chinese.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"A Pass in GCE \"O\" Level Chinese Language \"B\" syllabus or higher, or equivalent.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
