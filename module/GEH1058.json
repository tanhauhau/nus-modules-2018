{"ModuleCode":"GEH1058","ModuleTitle":"The Theatre Experience","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"While many of us spend much of our lives glued to small computer screens, theatrical productions continue to bring people together for shared experiences. What are the attractions of theatre, what makes it distinct, and how can it enrich our understanding of human society? This module, which requires no prior knowledge of theatre, starts with the spectator’s experience and works outwards. We learn how to analyse theatre’s styles and effects. We explore how human societies use theatre to confront questions and express beliefs, hopes, and anxieties. We examine how cultures influence each other through theatre, and how theatre provokes change.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"GEK1055","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
