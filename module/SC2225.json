We start with a historical\nexamination of the exchanges between two disciplines\nover the 20th century, from the use of ethnographic\ntropes by artists to avant-garde influences on\nanthropological practices of representation. We then\nturn to the deeper affinities with between the two as\nfound in the ethnographic turn in art,\nart/anthropology collaborations, and, more recently,\nthe social/participatory/relational turn.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-4-3","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Monday Morning"]}]}
