{"ModuleCode":"YSC4213","ModuleTitle":"Partial Differential Equations","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Partial differential equations are used to provide quantitative, predictive models for the universe. We study the essential equations of classical mathematical physics, including the heat and wave equations.\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including separation of variables, and Fourier series and integral transforms.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-2-6.5","Prerequisite":"Instructor approval or\nBoth Ordinary differential equations (YSC2xxx) and any one of:\nMathematical methods for physical scientists (YSC2205), Foundations of Applied Mathematics (YSC3240), Linear Algebra (YSC2232)","Preclusion":"Ordinary & Partial Differential Equations (YSC3230) (a&b)","Corequisite":"None","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
