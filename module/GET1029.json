{"ModuleCode":"GET1029","ModuleTitle":"Life, the Universe, and Everything","Department":"Philosophy","ModuleDescription":"This module offers an opportunity to grapple with some of the most enduring challenges to human thought. Our starting point is a conception of ourselves as free and conscious beings equipped with bodies that allow us to observe and explore a familiar external world. Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Preclusion":"PH1102E, GEK1067","Types":["GEM2015"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-26T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Friday Morning","Monday Morning","Thursday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Monday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-04T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Monday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Evening","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
