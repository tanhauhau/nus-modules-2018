{"ModuleCode":"CN4122","ModuleTitle":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","Department":"Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes.","ModuleCredit":"3","Workload":"2-2-0-1.5-2","Prerequisite":"CN2116 Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design CN2121 Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics CN3124 Particle Technology CN3132 Separation Processes","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-24T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-09T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
