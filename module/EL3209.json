{"ModuleCode":"EL3209","ModuleTitle":"Language, Culture, and Mind","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"It is generally assumed that language, culture, and our way of thinking are related. The relation, which is often called the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis or linguistic relativity, has been the subject of serious philosophical, anthropological and scientific inquiry. Taking advantage of the extensive bilingualism in Singapore, this module selects a few salient grammatical features and critically examines them within the broader cultural and/or cognitive contexts. Topics to be discussed include pluralisation, classifier, tense and aspect, kinship, polysemy, metaphor and bilingual acquisition. Issues related to translation will also be discussed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"EL1101E or GEK1011. Exposure to some linguistics is helpful but not essential.","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-06T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"]}]}
