{"ModuleCode":"UTC1102B","ModuleTitle":"Junior Seminar: The Darwinian Revolution","Department":"Tembusu College","ModuleDescription":"The scientific developments of the 19th century from geology to palaeontology, culminating in the theory of evolution by natural selection are arguably the greatest transformations in our understanding of the natural world in human history. Much of the science of the following century has been further refinements and elaborations of these earlier foundations. Yet most of these developments remain totally unknown or misunderstood by most people. Surely, therefore, an understanding of these issues is essential knowledge for any educated person today.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"GEM1902B%\nGEM1536\nGET1020","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
