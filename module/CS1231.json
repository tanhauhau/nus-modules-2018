{"ModuleCode":"CS1231","ModuleTitle":"Discrete Structures","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces mathematical tools required in the study of computer science. Topics include: (1) Logic and proof techniques: propositions, conditionals, quantifications. (2) Relations and Functions: Equivalence relations and partitions. Partially ordered sets. Well-Ordering Principle. Function equality. Boolean/identity/inverse functions. Bijection. (3) Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees, graphs). (4) Counting and Combinatoric: Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalisation proof: An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set; Algorithmic proof: An infinite set has a countably infinite subset. Subsets of countable sets are countable.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"A-level Mathematics or H2 Mathematics or MA1301 or MA1301FC or MA1301X","Preclusion":"MA1100","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-01T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Friday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-06T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Monday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
