{"ModuleCode":"CS4231","ModuleTitle":"Parallel and Distributed Algorithms","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This course will examine some fundamental issues in parallel programming and distributed computing, and the relationships between the two. Parallel programming: mutual exclusion, semaphores, consistency, wait-free synchronization. Distributed computing: time, global state, snapshots, message ordering. Relationships: consensus, fault-tolerance, transactions, self-stabilization.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms or CS3210 Parallel Computing","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
