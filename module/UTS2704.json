{"ModuleCode":"UTS2704","ModuleTitle":"Hard to secure easy to waste - Singapore’s food story","Department":"Residential College 4","ModuleDescription":"A growing population, changing dietary habits and climate change are contributing to the challenge of securing food for Singapore. Singapore imports over 90% of its food supply and uses under 1% of its land area for agriculture. In 2015, Singapore was ranked the second most food secure country in the world. On the other hand, Singapore’s food wastage has increased by 50% since 2005 and 1 in 10 people in Singapore is food insecure. This module takes a systems thinking and systems dynamics perspective to analyse and understand this apparent paradox between food security and food waste in Singapore.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-4-3","Preclusion":"UTC2712","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
