{"ModuleCode":"CS5332","ModuleTitle":"Biometric Authentication","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"Biometrics (such as fingerprint, iris images) are commonly used for authentication. This module covers authentication methods, different types of biometrics, pattern recognition, performance measurement, spoofing attacks, as well as issues such as privacy, user acceptance, and standards compliance. Students will gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the technology underlying biometric authentication, and the key issues to be addressed for successful deployment. Both the theoretical and practical aspects of biometrics authentication will be discussed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0-0-2-6","Prerequisite":"(CS2040 or its equivalent) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1505C or MA1521) and (MA1101R or MA1506) and (ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2334)","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]}]}
