{"ModuleCode":"IE6509","ModuleTitle":"Theory and Algorithms for Dynamic Programming","Department":"Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt","ModuleDescription":"This module covers the fundamental models, theory, and\nalgorithms for dynamic programming with an emphasis on\nMarkov decision processes (MDPs). We give particular\nattention to overcoming the ‘curse of dimensionality’ and\nfocus on modern techniques for solving large-scale\ndynamic programs.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-5-2","Prerequisite":"Suitable mathematical maturity","Preclusion":"BDC6305 Theory and Algorithms for Dynamic Programming","History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-29T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
