{"ModuleCode":"PS4208","ModuleTitle":"Theories of International Relations","Department":"Political Science","ModuleDescription":"This module explores major theoretical debates in international relations (IR). After discussing some of the standards by which we might evaluate theories, we will examine some realist, liberal, and 'alternative' theories of international relations, and the classic debates between these perspectives. Theories are applied to major aspects of international relations such as trade, war, alliances, and stability, for individual states, for particular groups of states, and in the international system as a whole. We will also explore the role of domestic politics in foreign policy. The module is designed for Political Science Honours students.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCS in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
