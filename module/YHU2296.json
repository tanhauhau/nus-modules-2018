{"ModuleCode":"YHU2296","ModuleTitle":"Ancient Epics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course conducts a deep reading of four major world epics of\nantiquity: Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey; Valmiki’s Ramayana, and Vergil’s\nAeneid. How is epic constructed, and what makes this poetic form an\neffective medium to explore questions of mortality and human\nexistence? What do these four epics have in common as literature, and\nhow do they interact transculturally? We will explore the epics as\naesthetic and cultural artifacts within their own historical contexts, and\nconsider how they transcend their own chronological periods.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and\nYCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
