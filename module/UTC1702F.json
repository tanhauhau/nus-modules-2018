{"ModuleCode":"UTC1702F","ModuleTitle":"Thinking in Systems: Disaster Resilience","Department":"Residential College 4","ModuleDescription":"Disasters like floods, storms, new disease outbreaks are increasing in the world. Climate change adds new hazards and uncertainties to existing risks. But are disasters a result of increasing hazards or are we becoming more vulnerable to them? Will they remain as hazards if we plan for resilience? Is resilience built or managed? Students will critically analyse these questions through a systems approach developing qualitative and quantitative models to understand relations between hazards, vulnerability, policy interventions and development practices. The module will encourage students to analyse case studies and grasp the dynamic complexity between risks, social vulnerability and resilience.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"GEM-coded GEM1915:Towards an Understanding of the Complex World GEM1914 Jr Sem: Systems:Systems Everywhere GEM1918 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources GEM1919 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare GE Reform GET1011 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World UTC-coded UTC1411: Jr Sem: Systems: Systems Everywhere UTC1702A: Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources UTC1702B:Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare UTC1702C: Thinking in Systems: Sustainability and Us UTC1702D: Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics To be Precluded with all other topics offered under the UTC 1702 parent module.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
