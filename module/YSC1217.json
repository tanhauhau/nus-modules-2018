{"ModuleCode":"YSC1217","ModuleTitle":"Creativity, Imagination and Theoretical Physics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"A good scientific theory is like a symbolic tale, an allegory of reality. Science is teeming with beautiful concepts, and the task of imagining them demands profound creativity, just as creative as the work of poets or magical realist novelists. This course explores in a manner accessible to non-scientists an unorthodox account of fundamental theoretical concepts such as Newtonian mechanics, superconductivity, and Einstein's theory of relativity, illuminating their profound implications.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"0-1.5-0-1.5-2","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
