{"ModuleCode":"TME3211","ModuleTitle":"Mechanics of Solids","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"The module covers topics on: Linear elasticity in which the general equations of equilibrium and compatibility are derived and its applications are illustrated for complex problems; Unsymmetrical bending of beams; Stresses in pressurized thick-walled cylinders in elastic and elasto-plastic regions; Stresses in rotating members; Introduction to mechanics of composite materials; and Experimental stress analysis with particular emphasis on optical methods. This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0.5-0.5-1.5-4.5","Prerequisite":"TME2114","Preclusion":"TM3211, ME3211E","History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-05T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
