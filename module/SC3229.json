{"ModuleCode":"SC3229","ModuleTitle":"Comparing Deviance: Perverts & Scandalous Improprieties","Department":"Sociology","ModuleDescription":"While norm violations occur everywhere, the responses to them vary. This module is a comparative study of deviance with a focus on empirical case studies. “Nuts, sluts, perverts” is Alexander Liazo’s phrase to refer to deviants from below like mental patients, sex workers and sexual outlaws. “Scandals” involve deviance from above, committed by authorities such as clergy abuse, official corruption and corporate malfeasance. Analyzing the range of underdog and elite forms of deviance in terms of disparities in their social constructions, criminal processing and dispensing of justice would enhance our understanding of structures of inequality and power.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-28T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"]}]}
