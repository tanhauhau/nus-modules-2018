Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
