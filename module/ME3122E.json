{"ModuleCode":"ME3122E","ModuleTitle":"Heat Transfer","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"This course covers the key concepts related to the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and principles of heat exchangers. It develops the studentsâ€™ proficiency in applying these heat transfer concepts and principles, to analyse and solve practical engineering problems involving heat transfer processes. Topics include introduction to heat transfer; steady state heat conduction; transient heat conduction; lumped capacitance; introduction to convective heat transfer; external forced convection; internal forced convection; natural/free convection; blackbody radiation and radiative properties; radiative exchange between surfaces; introduction to heat exchangers and basic calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0.5-0.5-1.5-4.5","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"TM2122, TME3122","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
