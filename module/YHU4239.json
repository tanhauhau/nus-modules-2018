{"ModuleCode":"YHU4239","ModuleTitle":"The Age of Capital: Business and Power in Modern Europe","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"The course explores why Europe emerged as a leading financial and\neconomic powerhouse by the 1800s, and why it lost its hegemony by the\nearly 20th. century. By bringing together insights from modern European\nhistory, business, economics, and sociology, we investigate the role of\nstates, politics, and business elites in shaping the continent’s history. Has\nEurope’s economy been driven by politics, states, or powerful bankers and\nindustrialists? How did wars shape European economies? We also\ninvestigate how cities, nation-states, empires provided different venues and incentives for economic activity and how European Union reshaped the sofar\nfragmented economies of the continent.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Prerequisite":"Completion of Common Curriculum modules, and a 2000-level history course.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
