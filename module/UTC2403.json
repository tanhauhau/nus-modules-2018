{"ModuleCode":"UTC2403","ModuleTitle":"Citizenship in a Changing World","Department":"College Of Alice & Peter Tan","ModuleDescription":"Originally a concept which bound individual members to a defined nation via relations of rights and responsibilities, “citizenship” in the 21st century is coming under unprecedented pressure from technological change and\nglobalization. This module will trace the development of the concept, the values and social assumptions which underpin citizenship, and the interactions between liberal, communitarian and civic narratives of citizenship from\nancient Greece to contemporary Singapore. Three key relationships are considered: the rights and duties of citizens in relation to government, to other citizens, and to non-citizens in and beyond the polity.","CrossModule":"UTS2403","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"1-2-0-3-4","Preclusion":"GEM2028%\nSSU2007%","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Evening","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
