{"ModuleCode":"EE6832","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Multi-Antenna Communications","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The objective of this module is to provide students the theory and concept of multi-antenna communications. The fundamental theory of conventional antenna arrays is covered in the first part. In the second part, the latest developments and techniques in multi-antenna communications are described, such as smart antenna technology, MIMO communication technique, adaptive array beamforming, etc. The focus of this module will be on the antenna array as a realization method to enable multi-antenna communications. The array design techniques will be highlighted and emphasized. The effect of antenna and array configuration characteristics on multichannel simultaneous communications and the dependence of the multi-channel ommunications on the antenna arrays will be fully illustrated and exemplified in this module.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"EE5308 or EE5308R","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
