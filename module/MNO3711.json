Change is often regarded with mixed feelings of excitement, fear and uncertainty.

This course is organised around these major questions: Why is organisational change so difficult? How can I lead and manage change in organisations? What tools and processes can I use to manage change? When and how should these tools be used and what are the strengths and drawbacks of each? Why do some change efforts fail?
