{"ModuleCode":"MA4254","ModuleTitle":"Discrete Optimization","Department":"Mathematics","ModuleDescription":"Discrete optimization deals with problems of maximizing or minimizing a function over a feasible region of discrete structure. These problems come from many fields like operations research, management science and computer science. The primary objective of this module is twofold: (a) to study key techniques to separate easy problems from difficult ones and (b) to use typical methods to deal with difficult problems. Major topics: Integer programming: cutting plane techniques, branch and bound enumeration, partitioning algorithms, the fixed charge and plant location problems. Sequencing and job-shop scheduling. Vehicle routing problems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"MA2215 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701","Preclusion":"MA3235, ISE students.","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-04T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Morning","Friday Morning","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
