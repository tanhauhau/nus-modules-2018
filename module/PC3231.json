{"ModuleCode":"PC3231","ModuleTitle":"Electricity & Magnetism II","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This is the sequel to PC2131 Electricity & Magnetism I, leading to the objective of understanding classical electrodynamics. Most of the examples presented require a certain degree of mathematical manipulation, as compared to a first course in electricity and magnetism. It covers the following topics: conservation laws, electromagnetic waves in vacuum and in matter, guided waves, the potential formulation, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, dipole radiation, radiation from point charges, special relativity, relativistic mechanics and relativistic electrodynamics.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-1-5","Prerequisite":"PC2131","Preclusion":"ESP2104","Corequisite":"NIL","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
