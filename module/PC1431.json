{"ModuleCode":"PC1431","ModuleTitle":"Physics IE","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"The module is designed to provide a clear and logical introduction to the concepts and principles of mechanics and thermodynamics, with illustrations based on applications to the real world. Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton's laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; gravitational force, field and potential energy; planetary motion; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; thermal expansion of solids and liquids; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, enthalpy and latent heat, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, mean free path; entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0.5-2-4","Prerequisite":"Students from FOE (i.e. Civil Eng, Environmental Eng, Common Engineering, Mechanical Eng, Bioengineering, Industrial & Systems Eng and Material Science & Eng) with ‘A’ level or H2 pass in Physics; or 'A' level or H2 pass in Physics; or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X & PC1222/PC1222X","Preclusion":"Students majoring in Physics or students who have passed in PC1141 or PC1142 or PC1433 or PC1431FC or PC1431X are not allowed to take this module.","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-26T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Friday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-03T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
