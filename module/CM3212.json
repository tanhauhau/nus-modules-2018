{"ModuleCode":"CM3212","ModuleTitle":"Transition Metal Chemistry","Department":"Chemistry","ModuleDescription":"This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"CM2111","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-05T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Friday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
