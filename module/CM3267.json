{"ModuleCode":"CM3267","ModuleTitle":"Computational Thinking and Programming in Chemistry","Department":"Chemistry","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces the elements of computational\nthinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the\nenvironment and food science. These elements include\nproblem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition,\ndecomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct\napplication of these elements will occur through\nprogramming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi\ncomputer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make\nreal-time observations of phenomena relevant to the\nenvironment and/or food science.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0-3-2-3","Prerequisite":"Either (a) OR (b) below:\n(a) CM2191 Experiments in Chemistry 2 AND\nCM2192 Experiments in Chemistry 3\nOR\n(b) FST2102B Chemistry of Food Components","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-29T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
