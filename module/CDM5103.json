{"ModuleCode":"CDM5103","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Topics in RNA Biology and Human Diseases","Department":"Dean's Office (Medicine)","ModuleDescription":"This module will expose our graduate students to the\ncutting-edge knowledge of RNA biology and their\nimplications in human diseases. We will discuss landmark\nstudies that offer a historical perspective as well as read\npapers from the latest issues of scientific journals to learn\nabout the most recent findings in this rapidly evolving field.\nWe will discover how cell processes are regulated by\nRNAs, RNA-binding proteins and the ribonucleoprotein\ncomplex, how changes in RNAs can lead to disease, and\nhow we can explore the therapeutic potential of RNAs,\nusing lectures and journal clubs given by clinical and basic\nscience experts.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-0-0-6","History":[{"Semester":1}]}
