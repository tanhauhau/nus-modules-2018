{"ModuleCode":"CS4243","ModuleTitle":"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This module is for undergraduates who are interested in computer vision and its applications. It covers (a) the basic skills needed in handling images and videos, (b) the basic theories needed to understand geometrical computer vision, and (c) pattern recognition. Topics covered in image handling include: contrast stretch, histogram equalization, noise removal, and color space. Topics covered in geometrical vision include: affine transform, vanishing points, camera projection models, homography, camera calibration, rotation representations including quaternions, epipolar geometry, binocular stereo, structure from motion. Topics covered for pattern recognition include principal component analysis.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"(CS1020 or CS1020E or CS2020 or (CS2030 or CS2113/T) and (CS2040 or CS2040C)) and\n(MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1506 or MA1508E) and\n(MA1102R or MA1505 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and\n(ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2334)","Preclusion":"EE4212 Computer Vision","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-27T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
