{"ModuleCode":"EE4214E","ModuleTitle":"Real-Time Embedded Systems","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"The objectives of this module are to present the theoretical foundations of real-time systems and to discuss the practical aspects of their implementation. It describes the characteristics of a real-time computing system and students are taught how to design a real-time embedded system using structured data flow methodology. Concepts of time-critical I/O and real-time deadlines are emphasized, as are the important aspects of real-time operating systems, scheduling and the practical implementation of embedded systems and firmware. Other topics covered include deadlock management and process communications. Various case studies on industrial real-time systems will be exhibited to give students a real-world feel for such systems. Students will undertake a mini project involving a real-time embedded system. Topics covered: Introduction to real-time and embedded systems; Time critical I/O handling; Real-time embedded software design; Concurrent programming; Real-time operating systems; Scheduling and time-critical processing; Deadlock management; Process communications; Case studies of real-time embedded systems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0.5-0.5-3-3","Prerequisite":"TE2101 and (EE2024E or TEE2028)","Preclusion":"TEE4214, TIC2401","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-04T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
