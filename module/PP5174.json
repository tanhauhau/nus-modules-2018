{"ModuleCode":"PP5174","ModuleTitle":"International Politics: The Rules of the Game","Department":"Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy","ModuleDescription":"That international politics can be conceived as a game with its own special rules is a truism for most analysts of the subject. Yet there does not exist a list of what the rules of the game are. This course will examine a list of ten possible contenders for inclusion in the list. The class will debate and dissect these “rules,” with the aim of arriving at a mutually agreeable and defensible list of the key rules of the international politics game by the end of the semester.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NA","Preclusion":"NA","Corequisite":"NA","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"]}]}
