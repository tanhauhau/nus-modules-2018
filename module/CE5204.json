{"ModuleCode":"CE5204","ModuleTitle":"Pavement Design & Rehabilitation","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The course introduces students to the basic principles and concepts of pavement design and rehabilitation for airfields and roads. Students will learn to understand the major aspects of structural and functional requirements of pavement, including load bearing capacity, material and thickness selection, durability against traffic and environmental loading, drainage and safety needs. Students will also learn the mechanisms of pavement distresses, and techniques and approaches of pavement rehabilitation. The principles of pavement rehabilitation in respect of nondestructive condition evaluation, pavement performance modelling and remaining life prediction will be addressed. The module requires each student to do a term project that involves identification of an aspect of pavement design or rehabilitation that warrants further study and description of the approach and technique of the proposed study. The module enables the students to acquire the knowledge of designing, maintaining and rehabilitating road and airfield pavements.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-1-6","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
