{"ModuleCode":"PH3249","ModuleTitle":"Decision and Social Choice","Department":"Philosophy","ModuleDescription":"This course is an introduction to decision and social\nchoice theory. The first half introduces the theory of\nexpected utility, according to which rational actions\nmaximise the probability of desirable consequences.\nThe second half introduces utilitarianism, according to\nwhich the right action is one which maximises the\nsatisfaction of desire for the population at large. Both\ntheories are controversial for their highly quantitative\nnature, their demanding conception of rationality and\nrightness, their insensitivity to risk and inequality, their\nprioritization of ends over means, and their tenuous\nrelationship to actual human behaviour and morality.\nThese controversies are discussed.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"GEM2006/GET1028 Logic","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-04T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Morning"]}]}
