{"ModuleCode":"TS4221","ModuleTitle":"Performance Research","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"Doing performance can teach us things that watching it cannot. This module uses performance practice as a research methodology to investigate otherwise inaccessible questions of creativity, embodiment, and performance processes. The three main components of the module include: defining a research question, designing and conducting experiments/observations, presenting the outcomes. Students will conceptualize and execute their own research project, in a relationship of collaborative research with artists. The nature of the project determines the resulting presentation: multi-media talk, lecture-demonstration, or short performance or workshop. The module will also focus on case studies from a range of cultural and stylistic sources.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
