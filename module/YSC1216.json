{"ModuleCode":"YSC1216","ModuleTitle":"Calculus of a Single Variable","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Calculus unites the study of instantaneous rates of change, area and optimisation, via the mathematical concepts of limit and infinity. This module provides a conceptual framework for Calculus. We eschew full mathematical rigour, but emphasise real world phenomena more than the rote formal calculations that make up a typical high school Calculus class. This module is suitable not only for those who have never learned Calculus before, but also for those who have completed a high school Calculus course. Students completing the module will be prepared for discipline-specific classes in the Sciences and Social Sciences which make use of Calculus.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-3-5.5","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
