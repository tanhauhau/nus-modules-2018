{"ModuleCode":"UTW2001R","ModuleTitle":"Discourse, Citizenship, and Society","Department":"Ctr For English Language Communication","ModuleDescription":"Citizens participate in society through discourse -- talk and texts. How citizens speak and write about social issues in face-to-face and online platforms therefore warrant careful reflection. This course aims to enable students to examine how individuals enact their citizenship through language and other symbols. Students will investigate how citizens mobilize language, voice, body and other resources to deal with issues pertaining to social differences, processes of exclusion, and participation in local, regional and global contexts, among others. By the end of the module, the students should be able to develop critical awareness of\nhow civic discourse shapes public issues.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"4-0-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"I&E 1","Preclusion":"Students who have already read an I&E 2 module","Corequisite":"","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Thursday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
