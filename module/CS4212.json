{"ModuleCode":"CS4212","ModuleTitle":"Compiler Design","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"CS2104 Programming Language","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-26T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
