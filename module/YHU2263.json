{"ModuleCode":"YHU2263","ModuleTitle":"Living in Sound","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Our ears have the capacity to distinguish the density of substances, volumes of space and the distances between objects. This course seeks to recover the dynamic, multisensorial phenomenon of music and to redirect thinking about sound as object in order to reconceptualise sound as an event that occurs through the practice of vibration. Approaching music as a vibrational practice offers the opportunity to examine listening practices around sound. This course attempts to awaken deep listening practices of built and natural environments, which students will then present in a public sound exhibition. No prior knowledge of music is required.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-9.5","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
