{"ModuleCode":"MNO3301","ModuleTitle":"Organisational Behaviour","Department":"Management And Organisation","ModuleDescription":"This course deals with the study of human behavior in organisations: how people influence organisational events and how events within the organisation influence people's behaviour. Organisational behavior is a field that draws ideas from psychology, social psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and management and applies them to the organisation. The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on. In the end, the field of organisational behavior asks two questions: (1) why do people behave as they do within organisations? (2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"MNO1001 or BH1001 or BZ1001 or BK2002 or HR2001 or HR2101 or HR3111 or HR3308","Preclusion":"BH3301 or BZ3501 or BK3309M or PS3243","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
