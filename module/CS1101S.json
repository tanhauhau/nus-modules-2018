{"ModuleCode":"CS1101S","ModuleTitle":"Programming Methodology","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include: functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-1-3-2","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"CS1010 or its equivalents","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-27T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Friday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-02T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Monday Morning"]}]}
