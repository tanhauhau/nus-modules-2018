{"ModuleCode":"YSC2230","ModuleTitle":"Probability and Statistics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"In addition to being interesting in its own right, probability theory\nforms the foundation of the study of statistics and finds applications\nacross the physical and social sciences. This course will provide\nstudents with a formal introduction to probability, with an eye to\npreparing them for further study in statistics and other fields of\nmathematics. We will return to topics first introduced in Quantitative\nReasoning, but study them from a more mathematical point of view.\nTopics will include probability spaces, random variables, distributions,\nmoment-generating functions, the Central Limit Theorem, likelihood\nfunctions, and an introduction to parameter estimation.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-6-2.5","Prerequisite":"YSC1211 Applied Calculus or with the permission of the instructor","Preclusion":"YSC1204 Statistical Inference","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
