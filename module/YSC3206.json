{"ModuleCode":"YSC3206","ModuleTitle":"Introduction to Real Analysis","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course embarks on a deep study of the real numbers and functions of a single real variable. Fundamental properties of real numbers – arithmetic, distance, limit, convergence, order – are developed from scratch. From there, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general notions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for functions of one real variable.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-0-8.5","Prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof OR YSC2232 Linear Algebra","History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-04T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
