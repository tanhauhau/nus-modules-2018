{"ModuleCode":"CS3244","ModuleTitle":"Machine Learning","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces basic concepts and algorithms in machine learning and neural networks. The main reason for studying computational learning is to make better use of powerful computers to learn knowledge (or regularities) from the raw data. The ultimate objective is to build self-learning systems to relieve human from some of already-too-many programming tasks. At the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the theories and paradigms of computational learning, and capable of implementing basic learning systems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"(CS2010 or CS2020 or CS2040 or CS2040C) and\n(ESP1107 or ESP2107 ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2132 or ST2334) and\n(MA1102R or MA1505 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1506 or MA1508E)","Preclusion":"Nil","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-26T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Monday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
