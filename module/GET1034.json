In particular, through understanding the constructivist theory of communication (Burleson, 2007) and Paul and Elderâ€™s (2014) critical thinking framework, this module will facilitate the development of deliberative and active citizenry among students, regardless of the position they hold in the community. Students will apply these concepts individually to short case studies and reflections.
