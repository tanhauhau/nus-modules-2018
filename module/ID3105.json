This is a “vertical studio” based design platform. Senior and junior students will participate in design projects which encourage cross-pollination of thoughts, skills and learning. The students will play the role of a junior designer and work together with the senior students from ID 4105 in the same platform. The objectives are to enable students to explore strategic design innovation through a simulated real studio environment. In this platform, students can select either conceptual or real-life projects led by our industry collaborators and relevant experts within the division.","ModuleCredit":"10","Workload":"2-6-0-17-6","Prerequisite":"Pass ID 2105 & 2106","Corequisite":"NIL","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
