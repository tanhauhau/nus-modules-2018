{"ModuleCode":"BL5234","ModuleTitle":"Theoretical Biology","Department":"Biological Sciences","ModuleDescription":"Theoretical biology concerns the application of mathematical tools to the solution of biological problems. Theoretical biology has yielded deep insights into the natural world and has found numerous practical applications. A basic familiarity with the history and principles of theoretical biology is becoming essential in fields such as ecology, evolution and epidemiology. This module will provide graduate students with the skills and confidence required to read the theoretical literature and collaborate with theoreticians. Each topic will be focused around a few relevant high-impact papers. Topics include predator-prey models, theories of biodiversity, population genetics, evolutionary game theory, infectious disease models, and forest dynamics models. For each topic, we will learn basic theoretical concepts that relate to the selected papers and discuss the papersâ€™ role in the history of theoretical biology.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-0-2-4","Prerequisite":"Undergraduate background in ecology, evolution or epidemiology.
