{"ModuleCode":"EL5216","ModuleTitle":"Corpus Linguistics","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"This module takes an empirical approach to linguistic investigation: it bases claims largely on computer-aided analyses of electronic datasets that are either manually built with linguistic purposes in mind or those that are readily found on the Web. With special reference to English, relevant topics will be introduced to suit particular needs; the corpus-linguistic methodology blends well with various linguistic levels, including grammar, lexis and discourse. This module does not assume any expert computing knowledge; while no computer programming will be introduced, participants will receive hands-on training in the use of standard corpus-linguistic programs.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-2-3-2","Prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department.","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
