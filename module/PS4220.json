{"ModuleCode":"PS4220","ModuleTitle":"Rhetoric and Politics","Department":"Political Science","ModuleDescription":"The art of persuasion is central to political activity. Aristotle's treatise on rhetoric, which analysed legal and political discourse, set the agenda for discussion of the subject until the modern era and remains supremely relevant to politics today. Political theorists and historians of political thought have recently rediscovered the subject of rhetoric and there is a wide array of fresh writing available for students to study. This module will provide invaluable insight into the nature of political speech for all who opt for it and greatly enhance their ability to dissect the language of politics.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in EL/EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
