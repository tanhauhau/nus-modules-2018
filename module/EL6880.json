The seminar is especially useful for students who are considering pursuing research in grammatical anaylsis/theory.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Admission to the PhD programme or doctoral competence in the discipline to be determined by the Department upon recommendation by the instructor.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]}]}
