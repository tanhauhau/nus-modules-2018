{"ModuleCode":"YID3203","ModuleTitle":"Another World is Possible: Ecotopian Visions","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"In the era of climate change, many scholars contend that we must develop alternatives to neoliberal fossil-fuelled capitalism. This course explores visions of ecotopian futures that might guide our imaginations, beliefs, and actions by examining the ways that various authors, artists, thinkers, and communities have depicted alternative ‘green’ worlds, challenging dominant ideas about human nature, gender, nonhuman nature, culture, society, politics, and the future. With a diverse range of texts, from Björk and Hayao Miyazaki to Kim Stanley Robinson and Ursula K. Le Guin, we pair literature, film, music, art, and architecture with scholarship from environmental studies, history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-4.5-5","Prerequisite":"YID1201 (Introduction to Environmental Studies) or YID2208 (Foundations of Environmental Humanities) strongly recommended but not required.","Corequisite":"YID1201 (Introduction to Environmental Studies) or YID2208 (Foundations of Environmental Humanities) strongly recommended but not required.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon"]}]}
