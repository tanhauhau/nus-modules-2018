{"ModuleCode":"CM4253","ModuleTitle":"Materials Chemistry 2","Department":"Chemistry","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to discuss important contemporary topics in the field of materials chemistry, e.g. nanostructured materials, hybrid composites, and polymeric materials as active components in electronic applications. Self-assembly of monolayers on metal surfaces and semiconductors, and other nanostructures (carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles, grapheme) will be covered. Material synthesis, processability in device matrix and stability will be emphasized, together with structure performance relationship. Formal teaching may be accompanied by presentations and case studies delivered by selected Industry researchers.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"4-1-0-1-4","Prerequisite":"CM3253","Preclusion":"CM4266","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-03T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning"]}]}
