{"ModuleCode":"UTC1702B","ModuleTitle":"Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare","Department":"Residential College 4","ModuleDescription":"Does a virus attack any individual? Or, does an individual create conditions for infection? How should hospitals plan treatment strategies and patient-staff movements during an outbreak? Should government allocate more resources\nto prevent onset of chronic diseases rather than managing the complications arising out of chronic diseases? Students will approach such questions from a systems perspective, which involves: understanding behaviours of subsytems and stakeholders such as disease/ infection, patients, providers, payers and society. They will also learn how the interdependencies and interactions between the different actors of the system can be integrated into a holistic system that enables better understanding.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"FOR GEM1919\nGEM-coded GEM1914 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere\nGEM1915% Towards an Understanding of the Complex World\nGEM1918 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources\nGE Reform GET1011 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World\nUTC-coded UTC1411 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere\nUTC1701 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare\nUTC1700 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources FOR UTC1701\nGEM-coded GEM1914 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere\nGEM1915% Towards an Understanding of the Complex World\nGEM1918 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources\nGEM1919 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare\nGE Reform GET1011 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World\nUTC-coded UTC1411 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere\nUTC1700 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Wednesday Evening"]}]}
