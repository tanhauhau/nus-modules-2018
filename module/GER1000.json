{"ModuleCode":"GER1000","ModuleTitle":"Quantitative Reasoning","Department":"Office Of The Provost","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to equip undergraduates with basic reasoning skills on using data to address real world issues. What are some potential complications to keep in mind as we plan what data to collect and how to use them to address our particular issue? When two things are related (e.g. smoking and cancer), how can we tell whether the relationship is causal (e.g. smoking causes cancer)? How can quantitative reasoning help us deal with uncertainty or elucidate complex relationships? These and other questions will be discussed using real world examples.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"GER1000E, GER1000K, GER1000W, GER1000R, GER1000S, GER1000T, GER1000P, GER1000B","Corequisite":"","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-24T13:00+0800","TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Evening","Friday Morning","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Monday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Tuesday Evening","Monday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-29T13:00+0800","TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Monday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
