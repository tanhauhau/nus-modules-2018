{"ModuleCode":"MUA1157","ModuleTitle":"Solfege 1","Department":"Yong Siew Toh Conservatory Of Music","ModuleDescription":"This module presents the practical study of solfege as taught in many conservatories around the world. The class will be exposed to many sight-reading opportunities from single line melodies to orchestral scores. The texts used are George Dandelot’s “Manuel Practique”, Dannhauser’s sight-singing books and Pasquale Bona’s “Rhythmical Articulation.” Students will be learning Fixed Do solfege as the main subject but the Moveable Do system will also be covered but to a lesser extent (as a preparation for future teaching situations). Four of the seven clefs used in music reading and transposition will also be covered. These are the Treble, Bass, Alto and Tenor clefs.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"0-1-0-1-3","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
