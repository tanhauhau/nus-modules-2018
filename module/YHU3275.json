{"ModuleCode":"YHU3275","ModuleTitle":"Descartes and the Perfection of Human Knowledge","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This seminar will survey the Cartesian system—showing how issues such as the reformation, religious climate, social issues (such as the earliest standardization of a curriculum by the Jesuits) and revolutionary developments in science and mathematics informed Descartes’ methodology, philosophy and publication strategy. Starting with his conception of human reason and methodology, we will consider the influences that shaped the construction of the Cartesian system from metaphysics and epistemology, mathematics and physics, to medicine and morals. The course will also examine the historical context of Descartes' thinking, in particular his intellectual inheritance from scholasticism and the broader contemporary reception of his work.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-1.5-8","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon"]}]}
