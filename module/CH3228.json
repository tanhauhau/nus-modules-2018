{"ModuleCode":"CH3228","ModuleTitle":"Classical Poetry: Writing and Criticism","Department":"Chinese Studies","ModuleDescription":"One of the best ways to understand the essence of poetry is to write one’s own composition.

Through critical analysis of Tang-Song masterpieces and traditional poetry discourses, this module will introduce the skill of poetry writing to students, deepen their understanding of the art of classical shi poetry as well as the historical, social and cultural backgrounds related to the genre’s stylistic development, and nourish their aesthetic criticism on poetry as a whole.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"Must obtain: 1) at least a B4 for (a) Higher Chinese at GCE 'O' level, or (b) Chinese Language at GCE 'AO' level (at GCE 'A' level examination); OR 2) at least a pass for (a) Chinese at GCE 'A' level, or (b) Higher Chinese at GCE 'A' level; OR 3) at least C grade for Chinese Language (H1CL) at GCE 'A' level; OR 4) at least a pass for (a) Chinese Language and Literature (H2CLL) at GCE 'A' level, or (b) Chinese Language and Literature (H3CLL) at GCE 'A' level. 5) Equivalent qualifications may be accepted.","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"]}]}
