{"ModuleCode":"UNL2206","ModuleTitle":"Nature's Threads","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module seeks to explore the importance of various key ideas in the history of physics by considering a selection of examples each semester as a means of examining the whys and hows of certain scientific revolutions. The theme underlying the choice of topics to be covered will be to explore the evolutionary aspect of scientific understanding which finds inter-connections (often, only much later, sometimes even centuries later) between seemingly unrelated ideas. The student should take away from this module a sense of the revolutionary nature and scientific importance of the ideas explored that semester, as well as the deep inter-connections which science establishes - 'Nature's Threads' as it were.","ModuleCredit":"4","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
