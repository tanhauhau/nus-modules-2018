{"ModuleCode":"YHU2289","ModuleTitle":"Ensemble Practice 1","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Performing in an ensemble is a powerfully integrative social activity. As a collective, ensembles consider ways in which to coordinate the synchrony/complementarity of actions performed by two or more individuals. Coordinating this synergy requires the exchange of information among individuals to facilitate understanding and prediction of others' intentions. This course will create musical dialogues, in any musical style, amongst vocal and instrumental performers and these combinations will be decided within the class group only. The skills in this course are designed to develop and refine ensemble cohesion and will encompass concepts such as deep listening, harmonization and improvisation.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
