{"ModuleCode":"PS2237","ModuleTitle":"Introduction to International Relations","Department":"Political Science","ModuleDescription":"Designed as an introductory theoretical module, it covers the basic concepts of International Relations in two halves. The first introduces the concepts of nation, state, sovereignty, non-state actors and their implications for the coexistence of nation-states, as well as a brief roundup of the instruments of conducting relations among them. The other offers a grounding in the major schools of thought on International Relations, namely realism, liberalism/pluralism and revolutionism. Additionally, there will be topics on radical perspectives such as feminism, constructivism and postmodernism. It is hoped the module will provide students with a foundation for other courses in the sub-field.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Preclusion":"PS2207, PS2207B","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-28T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
