{"ModuleCode":"IE3110","ModuleTitle":"Simulation","Department":"Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt","ModuleDescription":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-1-0.5-4-4","Prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","Preclusion":"DSC3221","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Afternoon","Thursday Morning"]}]}
