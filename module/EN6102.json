{"ModuleCode":"EN6102","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Critical Reading","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"This module is an advanced graduate class in critical reading. In it students develop three main areas of competence: 1) knowledge of different critical traditions; 2) awareness of the various problems of reading and interpretation; and 3) close reading of texts informed by the knowledge of (1) and the awareness of (2). In keeping with the advanced nature of the module, much of the responsibility for the direction of the work falls upon the students. Students will explore the texts of a few key thinkers and learn to understand some of the basic principles of critical theory. They will learn to apply specific reading strategies to selected texts and to raise questions about the reading process and its contexts. The emphasis throughout is on the development of students' critical awareness of positions, strategies and possibilities of interpretation. The module is a core course for research students.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Admission to the PhD programme or doctoral competence in the discipline to be determined by the Department upon recommendation by the instructor.","Preclusion":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-09T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
