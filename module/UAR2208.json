{"ModuleCode":"UAR2208","ModuleTitle":"From Lab to Stage: Writing the Science Play","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"How do we turn science into art? This creative writing module examines how theatre explores issues of science - - the personal, institutional and social dimensions of scientific inquiry – as students create new original dramatic works. Students read and analyse science plays from a playwright’s perspective, and apply the techniques learned to their own short weekly creative writing exercises based on scientific developments. These will be critiqued by their peers, and will culminate in the research and writing of their own one-act plays.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-0-4-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.
