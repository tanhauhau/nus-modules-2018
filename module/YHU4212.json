{"ModuleCode":"YHU4212","ModuleTitle":"The Problem of Evil from the Enlightenment to Auschwitz","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course examines changing discourses on evil from the eighteenth century to the aftermath of World War II; it explores shifts and developments in literary portrayals of the devil, varieties of theodicy, theories about the nature of human destructiveness, criminality, and the psychology of perpetrators of evil. Through a close reading of major works in philosophy and literature, we will pay particular attention to how understandings of evil have changed over time in response to both large scale socio-cultural transformations and traumatic historical events, such as the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the Holocaust.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-9.5","Prerequisite":"Requires completion of the Common Curriculum modules in the first two years or with permission from the instructor.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"]}]}
