{"ModuleCode":"EE4101E","ModuleTitle":"Radio-Frequency (RF) Communications","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission. This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems. Topics covered: Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole & monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays. RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design. RF Generation: conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators. RF Receivers: receiver and mixer parameters. RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.5-0.5-0.5-2-4.5","Prerequisite":"EE2011E","Preclusion":"TEE4101","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-24T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
