{"ModuleCode":"UBM2201","ModuleTitle":"Hormesis and Life","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"“What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is a common\nsaying that implies a positive response to external stress.\nYet, beyond the rhetorics, this notion is grounded in\nscientific principles. The goal of this module is to first\ndiscuss the theoretical basis behind this effect, and then to\nexplore the reach of this phenomenon across different\ndisciplines. These include addressing the risk-benefits of\nmedications and health supplements, the effects of\nexercise on the physical body, concept of immunity and\nothers. Beyond that, we hope to generate a platform for a\ndeep dialogue on the potential analogies of the concept in\nfar-reaching domains such as sociology, psychology and\neven economics (antifragility). Through this, we hope to\nadvocate the theories and practice of taking “calculated\nrisk” in life situations.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-1-1-4","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
