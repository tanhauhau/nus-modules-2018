{"ModuleCode":"CM4214","ModuleTitle":"Structural Methods in Inorganic Chem","Department":"Chemistry","ModuleDescription":"This module covers the commonly used methods to determine the structure of inorganic and organometallic compounds including symmetry operators, point groups and irreducible representations; Raman or IR active vibrational modes; the principles and theories of single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction techniques; assessment of quality of published crystal structures; NMR as a powerful diagnostic tool to determine structures and fluxional mechanisms. High resolution mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopy may be introduced.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"CM3211 or CM3212","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Morning"]}]}
