{"ModuleCode":"PH2207","ModuleTitle":"Hume and Kant","Department":"Philosophy","ModuleDescription":"Two major philosophers are studied in this module: David Hume, in the first half, and Immanuel Kant, in the second. We will try to determine what each philosopher's fundamental approach to philosophy consists in, and how it gives rise to his views on the nature of causation, the external world, the self, and the limits of knowledge. As Kant's first Critique was a response to Hume's philosophical scepticism, we will pay close attention to his diagnoses of Hume's difficulties and his proposed solutions.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
