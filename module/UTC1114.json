{"ModuleCode":"UTC1114","ModuleTitle":"Junior Seminar From the Fire to the Frying Pan: Cooking and Eating in Human Culture(s)","Department":"Tembusu College","ModuleDescription":"Cooking has evolved in unexpected ways throughout human history and has always been one of the most important markers of human culture(s). By engaging scholarship from various disciplines (but particularly anthropology), this course explores major themes that inform the way humans prepare food across different cultures and time periods. We will particularly concentrate on the prominent example of fish. Fieldtrips will be made to one of Singaporeâ€™s fishing ports and fish farms, and students will learn to apply ethnographic methods to the Singapore context. Students will also get to cook fish based on specific themes. Vegetarians and vegans are welcome.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-1-6","Corequisite":"Nil","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Morning","Monday Evening","Thursday Evening"]}]}
