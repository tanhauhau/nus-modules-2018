{"ModuleCode":"LL4233V","ModuleTitle":"European Company Law","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"European company law can be understood in two ways. It can indicate the EUâ€™s approach to company law and thereby lead to an analysis of the harmonized standards for 28 European nations. It can also be understood as a comparative approach to the different legal systems on the European continent. This course includes both aspects. It will first concentrate on EU legislation and jurisdiction, followed by a comparison of the legal systems of the two most important continental European jursidictions, France and Germany. It will lead to an understanding of shared principles of civil law jurisdictions and emphasize important differences to common law systems.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-0-0-0-10","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent.","Preclusion":"Students who are taking or have taken LL4233.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning"]}]}
