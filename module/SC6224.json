{"ModuleCode":"SC6224","ModuleTitle":"Producing Ethnography","Department":"Sociology","ModuleDescription":"Ethnography is the central mode of documentation and representation in social and cultural anthropology. ‘Ethnography’, the detailed depiction of human social and cultural experiences and their focused analysis, can refer either to the process of conducting fieldwork and undertaking participant observation or the product of such research, in a written or a visual form. The module recognizes the diverse modes in which anthropologists represent their works – including in visual, oral and digital. The emphasis is on ethnographic writing/ representation in an effort to understand the various methodological, literary and conceptual choices made by authors in the process.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
