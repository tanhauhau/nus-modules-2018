{"ModuleCode":"IE2100","ModuleTitle":"Probability Models With Applications","Department":"Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt","ModuleDescription":"The module builds upon the foundation in ST2131 and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling. Topics include: Review of exponential distribution; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; discrete time Markov chains; Poisson process; Basic queuing models and continuous time Markov chains and Renewal Theory. Students will eventually be conversant with the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-3-3","Prerequisite":"ST2334\nor EE2012 or CE2407\nor BN2102","Preclusion":"DBA3711","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-08T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
