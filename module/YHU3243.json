{"ModuleCode":"YHU3243","ModuleTitle":"Woolf, Historiography, and the Scene of the Modern","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"Woolf lived in an era of tremendous historical-mindedness in which artists,\nwriters, and historians were deeply engaged with how the past should be\nrepresented. Students will explore Woolfâ€™s engagement in this debate through\nclose analysis of her diaries, drafts, and published works as well as primary\nsource materials (museum artifacts and contemporary newspapers) that help\nplace her engagement in the social, cultural, and political issues of the early twentieth century. Was this engagement with the past at odds with a liberal\nbelief in progress, or was the past, for Woolf, a causal entity to be interpreted\nfor its historical difference?","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-4-5.5","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"]}]}
