The\nlearning experience is reflected in well-researched and thoughtful situational analyses, a learning journal, and midterm and final reports or presentations.\nCapstone experiences will be supervised by College faculty with expertise in the chosen area, with the participation of a qualified preceptor from the external\norganization.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-5-3","Preclusion":"SSU2001%","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Saturday Morning","Saturday Afternoon"]}]}
