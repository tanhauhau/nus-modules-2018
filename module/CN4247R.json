{"ModuleCode":"CN4247R","ModuleTitle":"Enzyme Technology","Department":"Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module will start with general introduction about enzyme, enzymatic transformation, and enzymatic process. It will be followed by various components in the development of an enzymatic process: enzyme classes and enzymatic reactions; enzyme discovery and high-throughput screening and detection methods; enzyme purification, characterisation, structure, function, and selectivity; protein engineering; cell engineering; biotransformation with isolated enzymes and microbial cells; reaction engineering; enzyme in organic solvent, two-liquid phase system, and enzyme stabilisation; cofactor regeneration; and product recovery. Finally, the students will learn process economics and industrial examples on the enzymatic production of fine chemicals.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-2-4","Prerequisite":"CN2116, LSM1401","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-03T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
