{"ModuleCode":"EN5883R","ModuleTitle":"Screen Culture In Southeast Asia","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"This interdisciplinary module will acquaint students with various theoretical approaches to the moving image, and equip them to write critically about contemporary screen cultures of Southeast Asia. Readings will be from media theory, art history and critical theory, as much as film studies. The module encourages students to think beyond the conventions of cinema studies (national cinema, genre, etc), the rationale being that as screen culture spreads beyond industrial cinema, so too should theory and criticism. Films studied will privilege independent and experimental work, video/media art, animation and web-based video, emphasising the diversification of moving image practices with video and digital media.","ModuleCredit":"5","Prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department","Preclusion":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
