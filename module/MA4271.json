{"ModuleCode":"MA4271","ModuleTitle":"Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces","Department":"Mathematics","ModuleDescription":"Students of this module will learn how to apply their knowledge in advanced calculus and linear algebra to the study of the geometry of smooth curves and surfaces in the three dimensional Euclidean space. Major topics: theory of smooth space curves, differentiable structures on a smooth surface, local theory of the geometry of smooth surfaces, the first and second fundamental form, Guass map, parallel transport, geodesics, global properties of surfaces: triangulation, Euler number and orientation, global Gauss-Bonnet formula and its applications.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"(MA1104 or MA2104 or MA1507 or MA1505 or MA2311) and (MA2101 or MA2101S)","Preclusion":"MA3215","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-09T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Morning"]}]}
