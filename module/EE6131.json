{"ModuleCode":"EE6131","ModuleTitle":"Wireless Communications (Advanced)","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This course covers various basic and selected advanced topics in wireless communication. It begins with an overview of current wireless systems and standards, followed by a mathematical characterization of the wireless channel. It then examines the fundamental capacity limits of wireless channels and the characteristics of the capacity-achieving transmission strategies. This part is followed by practical digital modulation techniques and their performance under wireless channel impairments, including diversity techniques to compensate for flat-fading, multicarrier modulation to combat frequency-selective fading, and multiple antenna space-time communications. The course concludes with a discussion of various practical multiple access schemes in wireless cellular systems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"EE5137/EE5137R or EE5306","History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-29T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]}]}
