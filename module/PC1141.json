{"ModuleCode":"PC1141","ModuleTitle":"Introduction to Classical Mechanics","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This module presents the fundamental principles of classical mechanics. It covers such topics as kinematics, Galilean transformation, Newton's laws of motion, dynamics of a particle with generalization to many particle systems, conservation laws, collisions, angular momentum and torque, motion of a rigid body, gravitation and planetary motion, static equilibrium, oscillatory motion and vibrational modes, waves, Doppler's effect and fluid mechanics. The module also has a practical component consisting of five experiments designed to enhance students' understanding of some of the concepts discussed in lectures. This module is targeted at science students who wish to acquire a working knowledge of mechanics, and is an essential for physics majors.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0.5-1.5-2-3","Prerequisite":"â€˜A' level or H2 pass in Physics or PC1221/PC1221FC/PC1221X & PC1222/PC1222X","Preclusion":"STUDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED PC1431 OR PC1431FC or PC1431X OR PC1433 ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE THIS MODULE.","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Tuesday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
