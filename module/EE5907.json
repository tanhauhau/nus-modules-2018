{"ModuleCode":"EE5907","ModuleTitle":"Pattern Recognition","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"Pattern recognition deals with automated classification, identification, and/or characterizations of signals/data from various sources. The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip students with knowledge of common statistical pattern recognition (PR) algorithms and techniques. Course will contain project-based work involving use of PR algorithms. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to analyze a given pattern recognition problem, and determine which standard technique is applicable, or be able to modify existing algorithms to engineer new algorithms to solve the problem. Topics covered include: Decision theory, Parameter estimation, Density estimation, Non-parametric techniques, Supervised learning, Dimensionality reduction, Linear discriminant functions, Clustering, Unsupervised learning, Feature extraction and Applications.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.75-0-0-2-5.25","Prerequisite":"Requires background knowledge such as EE2012 Analytical Methods or CS1101S","Preclusion":"EE5907R, EE5026 or EE5027","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-24T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-04T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]}]}
