{"ModuleCode":"LL5235V","ModuleTitle":"International Contract Law: Principles and Practice","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"With the onset of globalization, the study of contract law can no longer be confined to arrangements between private entities sharing the same nationality and operating in the same jurisdiction. The costliest and most complex contractual disputes involve States, State entities, or State-linked enterprises, and foreign nationals, as contracting parties. The introduction of States as permanent and powerful participants in economic life led to the emergence of a bespoke body of law – international contract law – to regulate these prominent contractual arrangements. This course is for students who have been targeted for regional and international legal practice, or who plan to gravitate towards transnational legal work in multinational corporations.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent","Preclusion":"LL4235/LL5235/LL6235 International Contract Law: Principles and Practice","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
