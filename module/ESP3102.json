{"ModuleCode":"ESP3102","ModuleTitle":"From Making Nano to Probing Nano","Department":"Engineering Science Programme","ModuleDescription":"The aims of this module are to provide a comprehensive coverage of a range of nanofabrication and characterization techniques. The fabrication part will facus on top-down techniques which will complement the bottom-up techniques covered by CM3251 Nanochemistry. Topics to be covered include: Nanofabrication: thin flim deposition, etching, photolithography, EUV, electron beam, x-ray and ion beam lithography, focused ion beam and direct laser writing, scanning probe based techniques, fabrication and alignment of nanostructures, manufacturing of nanodevices and nanosystems. Nanocharacterization: basic principle of imaging, wave diffraction, interaction of energy beams with materials, optical and electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, electron transport measurement, magnetic measurement and optical spectroscopy.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-1-6","Prerequisite":"PC2130B, PC2133","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
