{"ModuleCode":"ESP1104A","ModuleTitle":"Sensor System Electronics","Department":"Engineering Science Programme","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces students to the fundamental electronic principles of sensor systems for a variety of different disciplines. Particular emphasis will be given to circuits that are used in research and development, such as sensor amplifiers, filters, and data-acquisition. The module has both analogue and digital circuit principles, and involves project activities that involve hands-on construction of sensors, their circuits and translating their signals into digital data on to a computer.","ModuleCredit":"6","Workload":"6-2-3-0-4","Prerequisite":"A-level Mathematics and Physics","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
