{"ModuleCode":"QT5101","ModuleTitle":"Quantum measurements and statistics","Department":"Centre For Quantum Technologies","ModuleDescription":"This module deals with quantum measurement theory and the interpretation of the observed statistics. It covers advanced mathematical formalism of quantum measurement; Bellâ€™s inequalities; and the quantum-to- classical transition (notably decoherence). Emphasis is put on providing both the understanding of the concepts and the ability of using the mathematical tools.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"PC2130 Quantum mechanics 1 PC3130 Quantum mechanics 2","Preclusion":"There are no precluded modules.","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
