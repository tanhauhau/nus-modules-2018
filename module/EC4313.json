{"ModuleCode":"EC4313","ModuleTitle":"Search Theory and Applications","Department":"Economics","ModuleDescription":"This course studies models that depart from the standard Walrasian environment through the introduction of search and matching frictions, with applications to labour, goods, marriage and money markets.
