{"ModuleCode":"SE2210","ModuleTitle":"Popular Culture in Southeast Asia","Department":"Southeast Asian Studies","ModuleDescription":"Popular culture - in forms such as music, cinema and magazines - has been seen as a way for non-elite groups to make sense of their common experiences. In the modern era, these pop culture products have also been linked with mass-production and standardised, commercialised commodities which work to entertain and distract. However, more recent scholarship has seen popular culture as a possible means of contesting dominant ideologies. This module examines the debate by considering various forms of popular culture in Southeast Asia.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-4-3","Preclusion":"SE4215","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
