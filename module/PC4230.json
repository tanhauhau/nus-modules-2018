{"ModuleCode":"PC4230","ModuleTitle":"Quantum Mechanics III","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This elective module covers a range of advanced topics in Quantum Mechanics. The basics of relativistic quantum mechanics will be covered: the Klein-Gordon equation; the Dirac equation and the covariant formulation of the Dirac theory, as well as the plane wave solution of the Dirac equation, the solution of the Dirac equation for a central potential and its non-relativistic limit The rest of the module is devoted to special topics, which may include the van der Waals interaction; the behaviour of electrons in solids; masers and lasers, the EPR argument and Bellâ€™s theorem, the interpretations of QM.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-2-0-0-5","Prerequisite":"PC3130","Preclusion":"PC4130","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-01T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
