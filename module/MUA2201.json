{"ModuleCode":"MUA2201","ModuleTitle":"Keyboard Literature I","Department":"Yong Siew Toh Conservatory Of Music","ModuleDescription":"Keyboard Literature explores the great composers and their greatest works for keyboard instruments. The keyboard music that forms the core repertory of contemporary conservatory curriculums and concert programs will be the primary focus. Semester 1 slightly emphasizes music from the Baroque through Classical period, but works from all periods will be covered. Works for harpsichord, clavichord, organ and fortepiano will be examined, and practical experience performing on period instruments (especially the harpsichord and fortepiano) will allow the students to experience the sound world of the composer. (Non-Conservatory students that can read music may take this course as a free elective.)","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-0-0-4-4","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"]}]}
