{"ModuleCode":"CN4246E","ModuleTitle":"Chemical And Bio-Catalysis","Department":"School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn","ModuleDescription":"The first part of the module focuses on steps involved in catalytic reactions, such as adsorption, desorption and reaction kinetic models, chemical catalysis, biocatalysis, inter-particulate and intraparticulate transport processes involving Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor. The factors and reaction sequences causing the deactivation of solid catalysts will be covered. The second part of the module focuses on the various methods of preparation, characterization and testing of industrial solid catalysts. The module ends with some case studies on how to select and design catalysts for industrially important processes.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.5-1-0-2-4.5","Preclusion":"TCN4246","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
