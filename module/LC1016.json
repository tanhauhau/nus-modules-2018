{"ModuleCode":"LC1016","ModuleTitle":"Legal Analysis, Research & Communication","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"The objective of this year-long course is to develop analytical skills, research skills and communication skills (written and oral) in first year students. In Semester 1, we focus on objective analysis and communication and also introduce students to basic research skills. In Semester 2, we focus on independent research and advocacy. Exercises and assignments will employ real-life tasks, like office memoranda, court pleadings and client meetings, as means for students to try out their legal skills.
