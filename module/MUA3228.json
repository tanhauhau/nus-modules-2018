Students will\nstudy elements of music such as form, harmony and\ntexture as part of a process of internalizing and interpreting\nworks for the piano.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"0-2-0-1-2","Prerequisite":"This is an elective open to Conservatory piano students\nand all NUS students. Students are required to be fluent in\nharmony (functional harmony and chromatic harmony) as\nthe class offers an application of (rather than an\nintroduction to) harmony. As such, NUS students would be\nadvised to have taken either MUA 3224 or MUA 1201. For\nthose seeking direct entry MEP study at Junior College\nwould offer sufficient background as well.","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Afternoon"]}]}
