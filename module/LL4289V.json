{"ModuleCode":"LL4289V","ModuleTitle":"The Evolution of International Arbitration","Department":"Law","ModuleDescription":"The module has three distinctive features. First, it compares international commercial arbitration (ICA) international investment arbitration (ISA). Second, it focuses on the evolution of arbitration, in particular, on the development of the procedures and substantive law that have gradually enabled arbitration to become a meaningfully autonomous legal system. Third, it surveys a variety of explanations for why the arbitral order has evolved as it has – into a more “judicial-like” legal order – focusing on the role of arbitral centres, state regulatory competition, and the reasoning of tribunals in their awards.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
