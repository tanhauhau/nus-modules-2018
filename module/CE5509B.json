{"ModuleCode":"CE5509B","ModuleTitle":"Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures to EC4","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with sufficient design knowledge and skills on steel-concrete composite structures in their engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural steel-concrete components and buildings. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural design for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multi-storey buildings. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system. The module is targeted at practicing engineers, post-graduate civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on structural design.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"1-0.5-0-0.5-3","Prerequisite":"Background in Structural Steel Design","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Saturday Morning"]}]}
