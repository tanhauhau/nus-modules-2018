{"ModuleCode":"FMS1221B","ModuleTitle":"Science: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Beautiful","Department":"Biological Sciences","ModuleDescription":"Science is characterized by a mode of critical thinking and method of systematic enquiry applied to the acquisition of knowledge. The scientific process of enquiry is therefore governed by basic and general yet essential principles. Abide by these principles, we will likely do good science (even though the findings may not be what we have expected, if not wanted, it to be). Ignore these principles we will be on a slippery slope to bad science. Violate these principles we will end up with ugly science. Students will learn about essential principles of scientific enquiry and why they are important in the acquisition of knowledge, and when they are ignored or violated, it will lead to bad and ugly consequences as had occurred in the real world. Students will learn what is meant by scientific, pseudoscientific, unscientific and non-scientific ideas. Student will learn to appreciate the strengths (and limitation) of scientific scholarship as well as respect nonscientific scholarship. Finally, students will learn that the scientific approach when intersect with non-scientific disciplines (such as ethics, legal) can prevent science from turning ugly and when combine with creativity and imagination can produce beautiful results with powerful impact.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"Students who have read a Freshman Seminar before will be precluded from reading a second Freshman Seminar.
