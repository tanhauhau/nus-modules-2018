Through projects that are real public problems, students will acquire skills related to analysis of complex managerial problems, basic research, and writing and other presentational modes. The GSP also aims to develop team building and a strong sense of cohort.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"1-0-0-5-4","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"]}]}
