{"ModuleCode":"EE1112","ModuleTitle":"Engineering Principles and Practice II","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module is the second part of the two part module\nEngineering Principles and Practice (EPP) I and II and\nfollows closely the same learning objectives. Most modern\nengineering systems are more electric. They convert some\nraw form of energy, such as fuel, mechanical or energy\nstored in battery, into electrical form. We see this in every\nengineering system from trains, biomedical devices,\nchemical plants, electric cars, aircrafts and ships to ICT\ndevices such as computers, handphones, tablets etc.\nHence, energy conversion, distribution, and sensing &\ncontrol will form the backbone of this knowledge segment.","ModuleCredit":"6","Workload":"6-1-0-3-5","Preclusion":"EG1112 Engineering Principles and Practice II\nCG1111 Engineering Principles and Practice I","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning","Friday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon"]}]}
