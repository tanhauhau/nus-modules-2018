{"ModuleCode":"CN4221R","ModuleTitle":"Control of Industrial Processes","Department":"Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module will give students sound knowledge and appreciation of the development of plant-wide control (PWC) systems for chemical processes. The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.5-1-0-3.5-3","Prerequisite":"CN3121 Process Dynamics and Control CN4122 Process Synthesis and Simulation","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
