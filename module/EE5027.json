{"ModuleCode":"EE5027","ModuleTitle":"Statistical Pattern Recognition","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip\nstudents with the fundamentals of statistical pattern\nrecognition (SPR) algorithms and techniques. PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"3-0-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"This course assumes students have taken an\nundergraduate probability/statistics course, an\nundergraduate programming course and have at least a\nbasic linear algebra background, all of which should be\ncovered in a typical electrical engineering or computer\nscience undergraduate program.","History":[{"Semester":1},{"Semester":2}]}
