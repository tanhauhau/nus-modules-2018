{"ModuleCode":"CS5239","ModuleTitle":"Computer System Performance Analysis","Department":"Computer Science","ModuleDescription":"The objective of this module is to provide students a working knowledge of computer performance evaluation and capacity planning. They will be able to identify performance bottlenecks, to predict when performance limits of a system will be exceeded, and to characterise present and future workload to perform capacity planning activities. Topics include: performance analysis overview; measurement techniques and tools including workload characterisation, instrumentation, benchmarking, analytical modelling techniques including operational analysis, stochastic queuing network analysis; performance of client-server architectures; capacity planning; case studies.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"(CS1020 or CS1020E or CS2020 or CS2030 or CS2113/T) and (ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2334)","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
