{"ModuleCode":"ZB4171","ModuleTitle":"Advanced Topics in Bioinformatics","Department":"Biological Sciences","ModuleDescription":"In this module, students are challenged with practical experience in advanced bioinformatics research topics spanning database curation, literature text mining, and compute-intensive sequence and 3D structure analysis. Groups will design and carry out a pan-genomic analysis with a high-performance integrated database system. Individual students will learn to use animation software and raw biomolecular structure information as a platform for simulation and hypothesis testing.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"1-1-2-5-1","Prerequisite":"LSM2104 or or LSM2241 and LSM3241 (Life Sciences Students) OR CS2220 (Computational Biology Students)","Corequisite":"NIL","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-07T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
