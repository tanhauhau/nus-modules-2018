{"ModuleCode":"GE4226","ModuleTitle":"Mobile Spaces: Making Social Worlds","Department":"Geography","ModuleDescription":"This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the ‘new’ mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio-cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-4-5.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE,\nwith a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
