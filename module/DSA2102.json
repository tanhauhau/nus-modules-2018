{"ModuleCode":"DSA2102","ModuleTitle":"Essential Data Analytics Tools: Numerical Computation","Department":"Mathematics","ModuleDescription":"This module aims at introducing basic concepts and wellestablished\nnumerical methods that are very related to the\ncomputing foundation of data science and analytics. The\nemphasis is on the tight integration of numerical\nalgorithms, implementation in industrial programming\nlanguage, and examination on practical examples drawn\nfrom various disciplines related to data science. Major\ntopics include: computer arithmetic, matrix multiplication,\nnumerical methods for solving linear systems, least\nsquares method, interpolation, concrete implementations\nin industrial program language, and sample applications\nrelated to data science.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-2-4","Prerequisite":"MA1101R and MA1102R","Preclusion":"MA2213","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-04-30T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
