{"ModuleCode":"GEH1010","ModuleTitle":"Beasts, People and Wild Environments in South Asia","Department":"South Asian Studies Programme","ModuleDescription":"How do ideas about big beasts and the wild inform our socio-cultural worldview? In other words, what is a “tiger” when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Preclusion":"GEM1913","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-04T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Friday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
