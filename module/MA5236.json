Homology theory: Eilenberg-Steenrod homology axioms, singular homology theory, cellular homology, cohomology, cup and cap products, applications of homology (Brouwer fixed-point theorem, vector fields on spheres, Jordan Curve Theorem), H-spaces and Hopf algebra. Manifolds: de Rham cohomology, orientation, Poincare duality.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"MA5209 or MA5210 or departmental approval","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
