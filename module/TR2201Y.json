The pedagogical approach emphasises those market research methods, marketing strategies, pricing analysis and promotional techniques that are particularly useful for entrepreneurial settings. Particular attention is paid to the innovative use of internet as well as non-conventional techniques such as 'guerilla' marketing. The usefulness of these analytical tools is illustrated through concrete case studies of successful entrepreneurial marketing.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Preclusion":"TR3003","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
