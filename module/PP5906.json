{"ModuleCode":"PP5906","ModuleTitle":"International Economic Development","Department":"Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy","ModuleDescription":"All emerging economies face common challenges: usually,\ninadequate resources; otherwise, waste and distortion;\noften, corruption and technological deficiency. Developed\nnations can demonstrate best practice. But they can also\nfoist on developing countries restrictions on favoured\npathways to success: tight boundaries between state and\nmarket; interpretations of political freedoms; intellectual\nproperty rights regimes; open capital markets; a\nconstraining carbon-sensitive global environment -\nconditions that, while claimed universalist, did not operate\nwhen today's advanced economies started their climb to\nsuccess. All these problems test Asia's emerging\neconomies: this course develops economic models to help\npolicymakers understand and deal with these challenges.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"1-2-0-0-7","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"]}]}
