{"ModuleCode":"UTC1702D","ModuleTitle":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","Department":"Residential College 4","ModuleDescription":"Many of the worldâ€™s problems are linked to population changes: rapidly aging population, immigration woes, and the threat of environmental degradation to human existence. In this module, students will be introduced to population trends and be equipped to better understand fertility, mortality and migration and how they cause changes in population size, composition and distribution. It incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics. Students will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"GEM-coded: GEM1914 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere GEM1915% Towards an Understanding of the Complex World GEM1918 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural Resources GEM1919 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare GE Reform: GET1011 Towards an Understanding of the Complex World UTC-coded: UTC1411 Jnr Sem: Systems Systems Everywhere UTC1700 Thinking in Systems: Ecosystems and Natural UTC1701 Thinking in Systems: Diseases and Healthcare To be precluded with: All other topics offered under the UTC1702 parent module","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Wednesday Evening"]}]}
