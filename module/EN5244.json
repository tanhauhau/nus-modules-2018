{"ModuleCode":"EN5244","ModuleTitle":"Shakespeare And Literary Theory","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"This module approaches Shakespeares plays by considering not only genre and theme, but also their relationship to the development of literary history, including critical theory. The Shakespearean corpus has led to a multitude of critical possibilities, such that the text has lent support for materialism or deconstruction, for patriarchy or feminism, for the secure clichs of the so-called Elizabethan world picture or for their subversion and dissolution. Given the open-endedness of these critical possibilities, what does engaging with Shakespeare reveal about the relationship between text and context, between literary production and particular historical conditions, and the very making of meaning itself?","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
