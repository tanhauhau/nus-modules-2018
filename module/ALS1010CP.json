{"ModuleCode":"ALS1010CP","ModuleTitle":"Learning to Learn Better","Department":"Office Of The Provost","ModuleDescription":"This module considers evidence-based techniques for\nlearning derived from the fundamental science and\nunderstanding of how we learn. It reveals steps on the\npath to more effective learning by using a set of simple,\npragmatic rules: rules to build motivation and to speed up\nthe learning process over both the short and long term.\nLearners will appreciate learning rules and the scientific\nevidence behind them. They will also understand why,\ndespite sometimes being counterintuitive, they work so\nwell. This understanding will lead to individualised\napplication of techniques to improve learning.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"1-2-0-4-3","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Evening"]}]}
