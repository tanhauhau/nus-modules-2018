{"ModuleCode":"BN1101","ModuleTitle":"Engineering Principles and Practice I","Department":"Biomedical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module is the first of a set of two modules: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II). EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineerâ€™s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP I, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how to analyse a complex medical technology, how to design and fabricate a prototype and how to predict failure.","ModuleCredit":"6","Workload":"6-2-0-0-7","Corequisite":"N/A","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
