{"ModuleCode":"BMO6015A","ModuleTitle":"Organizational Behavior Seminar: Entrepreneurship and Innovation","Department":"Management And Organisation","ModuleDescription":"The field of OB (Organizational Behavior) needs to know how organizations get started and developed – this is the field of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship needs to know how new ideas get developed – this is the field of innovation. The module presents the current scientific knowledge on entrepreneurs, how they behave and what are effective and ineffective behaviors – all of this from the OB perspective. It further asks the question, how innovations are developed. Entrepreneurship and innovations exist in small and large organizations, in for profit and in non-for-profit organizations (e.g., as organizational culture). Thus, this is basic knowledge for OB PhDs.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"3-0-0-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
