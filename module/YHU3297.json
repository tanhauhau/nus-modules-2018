{"ModuleCode":"YHU3297","ModuleTitle":"Debate and Reasoning in Indian Philosophy","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"What does good reasoning look like? What does it aim for? How should\nwe argue with our opponents? Nyaya, a tradition within Brahminical\nIndian philosophy presented and defended sophisticated methods of\nreasoning and norms for debate that are still being studied today. In this\ncourse, we focus on sections of the Nyaya-sutra in translation and its\nearly commentaries, along with some Buddhist and MimaÂ¿sa texts. Not\nonly will we consider methods and norms, but we will look at how\nIndian thinkers put them into practice in arguments on topics such as\nthe existence of God.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-0-9.5","Prerequisite":"Recommend one philosophy course other than Philosophy and Political\nThought","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
