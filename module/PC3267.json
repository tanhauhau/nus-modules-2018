{"ModuleCode":"PC3267","ModuleTitle":"Biophysics II","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to introduce the principles and approaches of physics in the area of molecular biophysics. It includes molecular complexes of biomolecules; physical and symmetrical relationships between biomolecules; physical and structural characteristics of proteins and amino acids; symmetric and statistical descriptions of nucleic acids; first law and second law of thermodynamics in biological systems; bonding and non-bonding potentials, and stabilizing interactions in biomacromolecules, and the correlation to macromolecular structures; molecular mechanics in biological systems; bio soft condensed materials, bio-membrane and biomembrane structure, principles of molecular self assembly of biomolecules. There is a lab component included in this module. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics and life sciences.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-1-2-4","Prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2131 or PC2267 or EE2011 or Departmental Approval","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-10T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
