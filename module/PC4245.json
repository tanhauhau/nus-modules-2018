{"ModuleCode":"PC4245","ModuleTitle":"Particle Physics","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This is an introductory course on the fundamental constituents of matter and their basic interactions; important concepts and principles, recent important experiments, underlying theoretical tools and calculation techniques in elementary particles physics will be expounded. The topics covered are: basic properties of elementary particles and the standard model, relativistic kinematics; symmetries: isospin and SU(3), quark model; parity and CP violation; Feynman diagrams and rules; quantum electrodynamics; cross sections and lifetimes: deep inelastic scattering; and introductory gauge theories and unified models. This module is mainly targeted at physics majors.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-1-5","Prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC3232 or PC3130","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Thursday Morning"]}]}
