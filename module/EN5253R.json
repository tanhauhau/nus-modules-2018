{"ModuleCode":"EN5253R","ModuleTitle":"Writing in the Aftermath","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"The module addresses issues of historical trauma and cultural memory; through a focus on how such memory is manifested in aesthetic (primarily literary) representation. The module assumes a dual approach to the study of selected texts, requiring attention to the topic of violence and memory on the one hand; and the ethics and politics of representation on the other. Literary texts will illuminate problems of narrative agency, responsibility and testimony in the aftermath of a violent past. The conceptual framework of discussions derive from Maurice Blanchot and his influence on post-structuralism, and from contemporary uses of psychoanalysis by literary theorists.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-0-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","Preclusion":"NIL","Corequisite":"NIL","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]}]}
