{"ModuleCode":"UTC3100","ModuleTitle":"Third Year Experience Workshops: “Exploring Possibilities”","Department":"Tembusu College","ModuleDescription":"The backbone of the Third Year Experience at Tembusu College is a series of workshops designed to help students explore possibilities. From a personal and professional development angle, the workshops offer tools and techniques for cultivating selfawareness as well as foundational skills for dealing with different kinds of situations. Through experiential exercises and sharing with others, students reflect on their intrinsic motivations and examine their habitual thought patterns. This prepares students for the working world, and more broadly lays a foundation for greater self-determination.","ModuleCredit":"0","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"]}]}
