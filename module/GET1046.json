{"ModuleCode":"GET1046","ModuleTitle":"I Do Not Think Therefore I Am","Department":"Chinese Studies","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to call attention to the fundamental importance of thinking not only in learning per se but also in shaping who we are. It examines the nature of thinking, as well as its mechanisms. It aims to help students experience the excitement of thinking as they try to understand what thinking is; students are thus compelled to critique and re-examine their own assumptions about what they think they know and about themselves as psychosomatic learners and persons.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-2-5","Prerequisite":"Nil","Preclusion":"Nil","Corequisite":"Nil","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
