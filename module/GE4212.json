{"ModuleCode":"GE4212","ModuleTitle":"Environmental Modelling","Department":"Geography","ModuleDescription":"This course provides an introduction to the application of models (analytical, numerical, physical) through theory and practice in environmental or social sciences. Strengths and weaknesses of individual model types are discussed. Hands-on practical experience in the design and application of computer-based modelling will be a focus of the course. After completion the students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the concept of modelling, explain why and how modelling is employed in environmental or social sciences and possess skills in developing and critically assessing such models.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-4-5.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
