{"ModuleCode":"PL4239","ModuleTitle":"Social Psychology of the Unconscious","Department":"Psychology","ModuleDescription":"Conscious awareness is a prized possession of mankind. Lay people and philosophers alike ascribe sacred values to peopleâ€™s capacity for conscious thoughts, reasoning, and behaviour. However, social psychology research demonstrates the powerful influence of the unconscious, mechanisms that occur without conscious awareness, on high-level mental processes. In this module, students will be exposed to an array of research revealing how the unconscious affects social perception, social behaviour, goal pursuit, and complexed decision making. Students will acquire a basic understanding of how the unconscious operates and appreciate the real-life implications of the unconscious in consumer behaviour, public opinion, and legal decisions.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3-6.5","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232 - PL3236), in which one must be PL3235, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
