{"ModuleCode":"OT5207","ModuleTitle":"Arctic Offshore Engineering","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module is useful for engineers dealing with offshore structures for cold climate regions as well as students wanting to specialise in Arctic Offshore Engineering. It provides the knowledge of arctic technology for safe and sustainable development, and exploitation of petroleum resources in Arctic waters. Substantial use of recent offshore developments in Arctic regions is made in class discussions to provide students with the broadest possible insights as well as the basis to evaluate different structural concepts. Major topics include: Ice features, Physical and mechanical properties of ice, Ice-structure interaction, Design of offshore structures for ice-infested waters, and Ice management.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-0-7","Prerequisite":"CE4 standing","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]}]}
