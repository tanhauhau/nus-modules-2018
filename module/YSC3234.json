{"ModuleCode":"YSC3234","ModuleTitle":"Principles of Biophysics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This biophysics course will emphasize problem-solving skills (including computational) and laboratory techniques, focussing on applications of abstract concepts like statistical thermodynamics to biophysical phenomena, and the physics of soft condensed matter to “squishy” bio-molecules. Topics considered include protein folding, binding equilibria, self-assembly of biomolecules, membrane energetics, among others. Some questions addressed are: why are lipids essential to life, what drives ions across membranes, how do proteins bind to receptors, how can physics of biopolymers (DNA, proteins) explain their function, how can we explain spontaneous order formation in biology?","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-(2-4)-3-3.5-(4-5)","Prerequisite":"Sophomores can enroll with instructor’s permission. Given the physics bent of this course, it is recommended that students have taken or take concurrently some Calculus, in order to fully appreciate the content.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
