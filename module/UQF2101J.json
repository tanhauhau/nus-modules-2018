{"ModuleCode":"UQF2101J","ModuleTitle":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Pursuit of Happiness","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach. What factors contribute to positive life outcomes? Is successful living predicated simply by demographics or do social attitudes lead to a happy life? Are these two factors linked? We explore 40 years of data to answer questions surrounding the relationship between demographics, attitude, and the quality of life of individuals.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-4-2","Prerequisite":"NIL","Preclusion":"UTC1409 Jr Seminar: Pursuit of Happiness, offered by College of Alice and Peter Tan (CAPT)","Corequisite":"","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon"]}]}
