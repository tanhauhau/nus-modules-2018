{"ModuleCode":"BN2102","ModuleTitle":"Bioengineering Data Analysis","Department":"Biomedical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This course will introduce concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field. Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well as to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-2-0-2-4","Prerequisite":"MA1506 Mathematics II","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-09T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"]}]}
