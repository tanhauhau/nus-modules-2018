{"ModuleCode":"ESE6001","ModuleTitle":"Environmental Fate Of Organic Contaminant","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module examines fundamental principles that govern transformation and fate of organic contaminants in natural and engineered systems. Thermodynamic principles and molecular properties are used throughout the module to develop predictive relationships for the solubility of organic contaminants, partitioning between environmental phases, sorption to solid surfaces, and transformation processes.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-1-6","Prerequisite":"Graduate student standing","Preclusion":"","Corequisite":"","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
