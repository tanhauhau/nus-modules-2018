{"ModuleCode":"PC2130","ModuleTitle":"Quantum Mechanics I","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This module provides a rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics. It covers the following list of topics: Description of quantum systems: Hilbert space; observables, eigenfunctions, the statistical interpretation, the uncertainty relations; pure and mixed states using “density matrices” and the Dirac notation. Two-level systems are discussed as an example, considering Stern-Gerlach interferometer. Then the Schrödinger equation and stationary states are discussed, using the free particle, the square well, barriers and the harmonic oscillator as examples. Furthermore, problems in three dimensions are discussed: spin and orbital angular momentum; the Schrödinger equation in spherical coordinates; the hydrogen atom and the addition of angular momenta","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-1-5","Prerequisite":"Students who have either passed (PC1144 or PC1432/PC1432X) and (MA1101R or MA1513 or MA1508E) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1511 or MA1512) or equivalent.","Preclusion":"Students who have passed PC2130B are not allowed to take this module.","History":[{"Semester":2,"ExamDate":"2019-05-07T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Morning"]}]}
