{"ModuleCode":"PC3130","ModuleTitle":"Quantum Mechanics II","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This module continues from PC2130 and completes the basic formation of the student in quantum mechanics. Description of composite systems: tensor product, two-particle entanglement; systems of N identical particles. Perturbation theory: time-independent, both non-degenerate and degenerate; example: Zeeman effect. Time-dependent: Fermi golden rule; example: atom in a classical e-m field. Discussion of stimulated and spontaneous emission. Other approximation schemes: the variational principle; the WKB approximation and the “classical” region, tunneling and the connecting formula; the adiabatic approximation. Scattering: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-0-6","Prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2130 or PC2130B, and PC2134 or equivalent","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-01T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon"]},{"Semester":4}]}
