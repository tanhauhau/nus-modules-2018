{"ModuleCode":"YHU3223","ModuleTitle":"The Self in Comparative Perspective","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This course examines the notions of self and person, what it is to be an ‘I’, in a comparative philosophical context, drawing on key textual sources in translation, and comparing them to modern representations of the self. The course will raise questions about what are distinctive conceptualizations of self or person in traditional Hinduism and Christianity and how these differ from modern understandings, including distinct expectations regarding social role, gender, and anticipation of a future life. The course raises questions about what ways of thinking are shared and not shared between cultures and about hopes and expectations through the centuries.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-4-4.5","Prerequisite":"Completion of all Common Curriculum modules.","Corequisite":"None.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
