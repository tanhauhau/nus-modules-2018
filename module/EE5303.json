{"ModuleCode":"EE5303","ModuleTitle":"Microwave Electronics","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"With emphasis on fundamentals, this module develops analysis methods that are used to understand the operation and design of solid-state microwave electronic circuits commonly used in microwave systems. Methods for simulating nonlinear microwave circuits and processing of circuit parameters will be discussed. Major topics include: Linear circuit parameter conversion. Analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits. Lossy match, lossy feedback, distributed and power amplifiers. Oscillator theory; diode and transistor oscillators. Frequency multiplication, division and synthesis. Microwave frequency conversion, mixer analysis, single-ended and balanced mixers, diode and transistor mixers, image rejection, mixer noise.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2.5-0.5-0-3-4","Prerequisite":"Requires background knowledge such as EE4101, EE4104 or EE4112","Preclusion":"EE5303R","History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T14:30+0800","LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]}]}
