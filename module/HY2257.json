{"ModuleCode":"HY2257","ModuleTitle":"Law, Crime, and Punishment in History","Department":"History","ModuleDescription":"Law, Crime, and Punishment are all social concepts subject to historical change. In the case of law, historical precedents are important in determining how best to apply the rule of law. By presenting a set of themes in the history of law, crime, and punishment across time and cultures, this module allows students to examine processes of change in how these concepts are understood, applied and structured. History as a practice is an investigative process and both historians and criminal investigators seek to determine what happened, and why and how it happened. The course is organised thematically dealing with concepts of crime and law, particular crimes and laws, ways of understanding crime and law, and popular understanding of crime and law. On the whole the module has a western focus but there are global comparisons.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-0-3-4","Corequisite":"Nil","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-04T17:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
