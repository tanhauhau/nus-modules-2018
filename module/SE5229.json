{"ModuleCode":"SE5229","ModuleTitle":"Anthropological Approaches To Se Asia","Department":"Southeast Asian Studies","ModuleDescription":"This course looks at the relationship between culture, society and politics in Southeast Asia from an anthropological perspective. It highlights the main shifts in anthropological approaches to culture and society that have emerged with the newer understandings about power and history in social sciences. In particular, it examines changes within the interpretive perspective - a perspective most closely associated with Clifford Geertz, a celebratory figure in Southeast Asian anthropology ? to bring out the problems in the anthropological construction, interpretation and representation of culture to enable a more critical conceptualization of culture and society in Southeast Asia.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-1-6","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]}]}
