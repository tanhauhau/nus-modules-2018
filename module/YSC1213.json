{"ModuleCode":"YSC1213","ModuleTitle":"General Physics: Electronics and Non-Linear Dynamics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"This introductory physics course uses the platform of hands-on\nelectronics to introduce students to concepts in electro-magnetism\nincluding electrostatics and electrodynamics. Using electronic\ncomponents to build linear and non-linear oscillators, students will be\nintroduced to concepts in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The\ncourse is intended for both science majors and also non-majors.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-1.5-3-0-8","Prerequisite":"High-school courses similar to AP physics and AP mathematics","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
