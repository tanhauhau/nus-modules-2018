{"ModuleCode":"HY4231","ModuleTitle":"Family-State Relations in Chinese History","Department":"History","ModuleDescription":"People today tend to see the family and the state as two separate spheres with clear boundaries — private sphere and public sphere. In Chinese tradition, the family and the state are, however, inherently connected. Arranged on a chronological and thematic basis, this module provides students an opportunity to survey the development of family-state relations in Chinese history from the ancient to the modern eras. It examines how different teachings—such as Confucianism and Buddhism—significantly defined family-state relations and how the popular culture — such as dramas and novels — represented and reshaped these relations over time.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-3-0-3.5-6","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in HY, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track.
