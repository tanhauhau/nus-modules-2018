{"ModuleCode":"EN3245","ModuleTitle":"Feminism: Text & Theory","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"The module aims to introduce students to central concepts in feminism, and apply these to the analysis of literary texts, to arrive at an understanding of gender dichotomies that influence the writing and reading of texts. A range of feminist texts, from Virginia Woolf, Simone De Beauvoir, Kate Millett etc, to contemporary feminist critics, will be explored. These theoretical concepts will be used to analyse texts from different genres including short stories, plays, novels, visual texts etc. Students will be expected to engage with feminism as both an ideology and a literary tool of analysis.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: EN1101E or GEK1000, or a minimum of 12 MCs of EL modules.
