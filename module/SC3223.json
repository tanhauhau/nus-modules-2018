It covers some of the major theoretical perspectives on how objectivity, subjectivity and relations of power are expressed by visual means. These perspectives are grounded and assessed with reference to historical and contemporary practices of image-making and imageconsumption, covering a variety of visual media and application domains. At the end of the module, students will have gained familiarity with key repertoires for the study of visual culture, and increased their “visual literacy” as image producers and consumers.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-1-2-4","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-03T13:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
