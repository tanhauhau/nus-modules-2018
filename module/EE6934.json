{"ModuleCode":"EE6934","ModuleTitle":"Deep Learning (Advanced)","Department":"Electrical & Computer Engineering","ModuleDescription":"Deep learning refers to machine learning methods based\non deep neural networks to learn data representation and\nperform learning tasks. This course covers advanced\ntopics on deep learning. Students taking this course will\nlearn theories, recent models and algorithms. The course\nstarts with machine learning basics and classical neural\nnetwork models, followed by optimization techniques for\ndeep convolutional neural networks, and advanced topics\nincluding recurrent neural networks, deep reinforcement\nlearning, deep generative models and their applications to\ncomputer vision and speech recognition. The students are\nexpected to have good knowledge on calculus, linear\nalgebra, probability, statistics as a prerequisite.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"- College Calculus, Linear Algebra\n- Basic Probability and Statistics (e.g. EE2012)\n- Scientific programming language, such as Python (e.g. IT1007). All class assignments will be in Python (and use numpy).","Preclusion":"EE5934 Deep Learning","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening"]}]}
