{"ModuleCode":"UNL2210","ModuleTitle":"Mathematics and Reality","Department":"University Scholars Programme","ModuleDescription":"What is the nature of Reality and how can we be sure about what we know? Do mathematical constructs such as symmetry groups and infinity point beyond themselves to a higher reality? How do we account for the fact that mathematics is so effective in describing nature? Is it mere language or is it the reality itself? This module explores the intimate link between reality and mathematics and how the latter has been unreasonably effective in providing a description of nature. Students will be taken through a journey that showcases the developments that have shaped our current views on the topic.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-4-0-0-6","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
