{"ModuleCode":"YSC2227","ModuleTitle":"C: A Language for Science and Engineering","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"C is one of the most commonly used programming languages, especially in science, engineering and electronics. Many operating systems and microcontrollers are at least partly coded in C. C is lightweight, fast and offers a complex memory management system. This apparent simplicity does not mean that it is simple to learn and master though, as it requires deep understanding of how memory works and how data is represented. In this course, we will cover the C language along with memory management and segmentation. C can be useful for Capstones in applied mathematics and natural sciences.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"0-3-0-5.5-1.5","Prerequisite":"YSC2221 Introduction to Python or YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or permission of instructor","Preclusion":"YSC3217 Programming Operating Systems, Interfaces & eXtras\nYSC3232 Object-oriented Programming (or previously YSC3207 Principles and Tools of Software Development)","Corequisite":"","History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Thursday Evening"]},{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Tuesday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
