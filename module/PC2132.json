{"ModuleCode":"PC2132","ModuleTitle":"Classical Mechanics","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"This module aims to consider the principles of mechanics in a rigorous mathematical framework, and to establish a bridge to the principles of modern physics. The topics to be covered include: kinematics; damped and driven oscillators; energy and angular momentum, conservative forces; twobody and many-body problems, centre-of-mass; central-force motion, inverse square law, orbits, scattering; action principle; Lagrangian mechanics; Hamiltonian mechanics; small-amplitude oscillations, normal modes; rotating rigid bodies; rotating reference frames, centrifugal and Coriolis forces, Foucault's pendulum. A good command of calculus and some basic knowledge of linear algebra are required.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-1-0-1-5","Prerequisite":"Students who have either passed (PC1144 or PC1432/PC1432X) and (MA1101R or MA1513 or MA1508E) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1511 or MA1512) or equivalent.","Types":["UEM"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-30T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
