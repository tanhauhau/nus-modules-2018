{"ModuleCode":"CG1112","ModuleTitle":"Engineering Principles and Practice II","Department":"Computing & Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module will be for the students who have completed EPP I and the project scope extends to handle challenges in large-scale systems. Similar to EPP I, students will first learn the fundamental principles on certain advanced concepts and then design and programme a real-world system. The module involves designing a complex computer engineering system that facilitates information processing, real-world interfacing, and understanding the effects of certain useful metrics such as, scaling, safety, security, sustainability, societal impact, fault-tolerant design, etc.","ModuleCredit":"6","Workload":"0-2-6-3-4","Prerequisite":"CS1010 Programming Methodology CG1111 Engineering Principles and Practice I","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Wednesday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Wednesday Morning","Tuesday Morning","Thursday Morning","Friday Afternoon"]}]}
