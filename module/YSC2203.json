{"ModuleCode":"YSC2203","ModuleTitle":"Classical Mechanics","Department":"Yale-NUS College","ModuleDescription":"The course discusses the principles of classical mechanics within a rigorous mathematical framework. Topics may include kinematics, conservative forces, central-force motion, small oscillations, rigid bodies, variational problems, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, non-inertial frames, and special relativity. This course is a prerequisite for most of the Major modules in Physics.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"0-4-0-0-8.5","Prerequisite":"YSC1121 Applied Calculus or equivalent; AND YSC1213 General Physics: Electronics and Non-Linear Dynamics; OR with the permission of the instructor. Students are requested to consult with the instructor on the equivalency of the calculus course(s) that they have taken previously","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon","Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
