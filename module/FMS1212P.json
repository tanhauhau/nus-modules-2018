{"ModuleCode":"FMS1212P","ModuleTitle":"SYC: Simple Yet Complex","Department":"Physics","ModuleDescription":"Students often tend to think that if a system displays a complex behavior, it must be itself somehow complicated, difficult to describe. The aim of the module is to show, in a playful way, that this is not (always) the case, that really simple systems ranging from physics, meteorology, engineering, computer science, biology and economics, can have a rich, complex â€¦ and unpredictable behavior. Many notions are at the heart of this module such as determinism versus predictability, chaos, the need for a statistical description, random walks, ergodicity, entropy, fractals, cellular automata, self-organized criticality, emergent behavior, etc.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-2-0-4-4","Preclusion":"Students who have read a Freshman Seminar before will be precluded from reading a second Freshman Seminar. Students staying in Residential Colleges in UTown who will be reading or have read the Junior Seminars will be precluded from reading Freshman Seminar in the Faculty.","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Afternoon"]}]}
