{"ModuleCode":"EN4880A","ModuleTitle":"Usurpation and Authority, 1558-1674","Department":"English Language & Literature","ModuleDescription":"This module explores the twinned ideas of usurpation and transgression in English Renaissance literature, analyzing the attempt to cross boundaries that define the norm in the polity and in moral, religious, and sexual spheres. We will look at how hierarchies established by religion, government, and custom seek to maintain and to justify the status quo. We will ask how literary texts register awareness of, and enter into dialogue with, these hierarchies. Different genres such as the play, the love lyric, the devotional lyric, and the epic will be invoked for our analysis of the cultural preoccupation with usurpation and transgression.","ModuleCredit":"5","Workload":"3-0-0-2-7.5","Prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Thursday Afternoon"]}]}
