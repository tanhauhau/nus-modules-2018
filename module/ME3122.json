{"ModuleCode":"ME3122","ModuleTitle":"Heat Transfer","Department":"Mechanical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This course covers the key concepts related to the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and principles of heat exchangers. It develops the studentsâ€™ proficiency in applying these heat transfer concepts and principles, to analyse and solve practical engineering problems involving heat transfer processes. Topics include introduction to heat transfer; steady state heat conduction; transient heat conduction; lumped capacitance; introduction to convective heat transfer; external forced convection; internal forced convection; natural/free convection; blackbody radiation and radiative properties; radiative exchange between surfaces; introduction to heat exchangers and basic calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0.5-0.5-1.5-4.5","Prerequisite":"PC1431FC/PC1431/PC1431X","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-11-28T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon"],"TutorialPeriods":["Tuesday Afternoon","Thursday Afternoon","Friday Afternoon","Monday Morning","Wednesday Afternoon","Thursday Morning","Friday Morning"]}]}
