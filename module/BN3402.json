{"ModuleCode":"BN3402","ModuleTitle":"Bio-Analytical Methods In Bioengineering","Department":"Biomedical Engineering","ModuleDescription":"The aim of the course is to give a theoretical and practical introduction into selected analytical methods for the characterization of biomaterials, tissues, biomolecules and immobilized biological molecules. The methods are focused to obtain: structural, topological (e.g. atomic force microscopy), chemical (e.g. spectrometry) and functional (e.g. surface palsmon resonance and bioassays) information for the characterization of biomolecules, biomaterials, tissues and biomodified materials.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"2-1-1-3-3","Prerequisite":"(CM1121 or CM1501) and (LSM1101 or LSM1401)","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"ExamDate":"2018-12-06T09:00+0800","LecturePeriods":["Wednesday Morning"],"TutorialPeriods":["Wednesday Afternoon","Wednesday Morning"]}]}
