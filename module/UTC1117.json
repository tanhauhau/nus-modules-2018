{"ModuleCode":"UTC1117","ModuleTitle":"Junior Seminar: Radiation and Society","Department":"Tembusu College","ModuleDescription":"Reports of radiation leaks at the Fukushima nuclear facility in Japan, following the earthquake/tsunami disaster in 2011, have triggered concern and even panic among members of the general public. In this seminar, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to debates and controversies about radiation and nuclear technology. Key topics include: (1) the science behind radiation effects, and the way in which policymakers and others grapple with scientific uncertainties; (2) the challenges of expert-lay communication about radiation risk, both after nuclear disaster and relating to consumer technologies; (3) the broader context that shapes debates over nuclear power in Japan and elsewhere.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"0-3-0-3-4","Preclusion":"GEM2910/GEM2910X/UTC2110","Types":["Module"],"History":[{"Semester":1,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Evening","Tuesday Morning"]}]}
