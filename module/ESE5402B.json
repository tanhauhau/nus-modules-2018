{"ModuleCode":"ESE5402B","ModuleTitle":"Biotechnologies for Industrial Wastewater Control","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This course introduces biological technologies that can be\nused for the treatment of different industrial wastewater\ntreatment. Characterization of industrial wastewater and\ndifferent biological processes such as upflow anaerobic\nsludge blanket processes, activated sludge process,\nmembrane bioreactor etc. shall be covered for the removal\nof organics and nutrients in specific industrial wastewater,\nproducing treated effluents for discharge or water\nreclamation/wastewater reuse. The students will gain\nknowledge on the characterization of industrial wastewater,\nconsiderations required for the selection of appropriate\nbiological processes and the design of specific biological\nprocesses for industrial wastewater treatment.","ModuleCredit":"2","Workload":"3-0-0-0.5-1.5","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Monday Morning","Tuesday Afternoon","Friday Morning","Saturday Morning"]}]}
