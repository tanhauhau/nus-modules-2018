{"ModuleCode":"CE5883A","ModuleTitle":"Topics in Hydraulic & Water Resources - Environmental Hydraulics","Department":"Civil & Environmental Engineering","ModuleDescription":"This module introduces students to the hydrodynamic aspects of water quality management in surface water bodies, with the objective of providing a fundamental understanding of the processes that govern water flow in the environment and the impact of human interference on natural flows. The module serves as an introduction to the processes of transport and mixing of pollutants in surface water flows. The topics that will be covered include advective, diffusive and dispersive processes in the water environment, applications to transport and mixing in rivers, estuaries and reservoirs, and the design of wastewater discharge systems.","ModuleCredit":"4","Workload":"3-0-0-4-3","Prerequisite":"CE 2134 Hydraulics and/or fluid mechanics background","History":[{"Semester":2,"LecturePeriods":["Friday Evening"]}]}
